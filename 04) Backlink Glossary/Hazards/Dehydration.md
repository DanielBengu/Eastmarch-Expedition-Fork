A creature requires an amount of water per day based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the required water for a day gains 1 [[Exhaustion]] level at the day’s end. Exhaustion caused by dehydration can’t be removed until the creature drinks the full amount of water required for a day.
### Water Needs per Day
