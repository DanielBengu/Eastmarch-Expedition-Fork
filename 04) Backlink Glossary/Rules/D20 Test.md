D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [[Ability Check|ability checks]], [[Attack Roll|attack rolls]], and [[Saving Throw|saving throws]]. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. *See Also* "Playing the Game" ("[[04) D20 Tests|D20 Tests]]")
