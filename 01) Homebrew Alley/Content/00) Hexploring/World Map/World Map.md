## World Map
> On the world map, one hex is 24 miles across.
  
The world map scale is ideal for calculating travel time for long journeys. It doesn’t have to be a map of the whole world, just a large area.

***It’s Just A Reference.*** This scale is typically best used to offhandedly solve the math of travel time over longer distances, quickly and easily. If you want something more granular, take a look at the Regional Map.

***Dangers on the Way.*** Instead of using Random Encounters, if you wish to make the journey take more time, consider building an exciting encounter and make it take place at an interesting point on the route to the destination, or on the travel vessel itself. For example the PC boat might be attacked, or a storm might have the players fight to keep the ship afloat.

***Timeskip The Journey.*** Journeys of this length are usually best skimmed over, only stopping to highlight settlements or points of interest. Travel is the focus here, rather than exploration. This also means that these scenes might mean a long in-game time, but very short play times. The action is what makes DnD fun, skip to the fun.

#### Travelling as a Party
Use the following measurements and modifiers to adjudicate travel times on the world map for a character or a party of characters.

***Along a Road.*** Entering a road hex on foot takes a day’s march.

***On Horseback.*** Entering hills, plains, or road hexes on horseback takes half as long as walking.

***Trackless Wilderness.*** Entering a hex with no roads or meaningful tracks takes twice as long.

***Difficult Terrain.*** Entering a forest, mountain, or swamp hex takes twice as long.

#### Stack Modifiers
If multiple factors are modifying your travel time, stack those modifiers together to get the final result. For example, if you enter a trackless wilderness in a mountain hex, you double the travel time twice. So,  it takes 4 days to enter that hex. Or, if you enter a trackless wilderness hills hex on horseback, it takes 1 day to enter the hex.

#### Travel in a Vehicle
Use the following measurements and modifiers to determine travel times on the world map for a vehicle that can be operated day and night for more efficient travel.

***Rowboats and Keelboats.*** Move 1 hex in a day.
***By Galley.*** Moves 4 hexes in a day.
***By Ship.*** Moves 5 hexes in a day.
***By Airship.*** Moves 8 hexes in a day.
***By Train.*** Moves 1 hex in an hour.
