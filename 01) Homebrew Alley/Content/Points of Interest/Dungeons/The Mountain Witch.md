#TODO
# The Mountain Witch
*The search for dangerous recipes.*

## Prerequisites
- [[The Withered Vale]] has to be cleared,
- and **Alina** must have survived.

## Cleared
idk yet

---

## Scouting the Location
- From nearby [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/Rules/Hex|hexes]], players can easily see a structure near the peek of the mountain just over a cliff

## The Rooms
### The Entrance
> > You reach the foots of the cliff and look up towards what seems to be a wooden structure.
> > The rock-side is steep, the cold is knifing your bones, yet the rugged climb has enough handholds to be just about possible.

Climbing to the top requires each character to do an [[Athletics]] or [[Acrobatics]] check against the following table:

| Roll | Outcome | Damage Modifier |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | The player almost reaches the very top, failing only on the last foothold and falls 30ft. to the ground | Normal |
| 2-5 | The player makes it 2/3 of the way, but looses grip and falls 20ft. | Normal |
| 6-10 | The player barely makes it 10ft. high before losing grip and falling | 1d6 |
| 11-14 | The player makes it half way through the climb before a gust of wind makes them lose grip and fall 15ft.. Fortunately, the soft snow below softens their impact. | 1d6 - 2 |
| 15+ | The player succeeds. Move to [[#The Puzzle]]. | 0 |

### The Puzzle
> > At the mountain's summit, you are greeted by a strange sight. A lonely circular hut of smooth wood and ice stands against the mountain's snow. Perfectly seamless - no door, no window, no smoke hole.
> > As you approach, you hear a faint chime ring from within, as if acknowledging your arrival. 
> > You walk around to check for an entrance, yet none are found. You only find some carved writings.

The writings are in **Sylvan** and they read: *"Those who seek warmth must be still."*

#### Mechanics
- The walls - despite being covered in ice - are warm to the touch.
	- Knocking produces a soft echo - like hitting hollow wood.
- Use a real life chronometer to keep track how long the players stay still and don't speak
	- When it reaches 30 sec for the first time - a glowing circle starts to appear.
	- Moving or speaking resets the timer

#### Solution
This puzzle is supposed to embody calmness of mind/spirit and requires all players to be still and silent for 1 minute both in game and in real life.
> > A circular doorway forms in front of you. A soft breeze - warm and smelling faintly of pine and frost - beckons you inside.
> > “You brought the calm with you — and left the storm outside. Welcome, wanderers.”
> > A soft female voice from within.

If the party decides to enter, move on to [[#The Setback]].

### The Setback
> > The interior is much larger than the outside, filled with warm light from a hearth on the left side of the room.
> > Directly in front of you, a large library of books and scrolls adorns the wall.
> > To the right, two door lead somewhere deeper in the hut.
> > Near the hearth, two light blue cushioned chairs and a sofa face each others around a deep blue carpet. A lonely oak-wood table hold a opened book.
> > Seated on the sofa, an elven woman, with bright golden hair smiles at you.

The woman presents herself as *Alina*, an elven mage who enjoys calm and solitude. She is seeking adventurers for:
- Slaying a [[Adult White Dragon]] nested about 6 hours North-East from her hut
	- She clearly states that she is not powerful enough to take the dragon on herself
	- She needs some of its meat, and scales
- She is willing to reward the parties effort with a **rare** magic item (from the Arcana Loot tables in the DM's Guide) as well as some soup on their return.
- She is willing to let the party stay the night, in the room on the left, assuming they agree to not leave the room until morning. She promises no harm will be done to them, and that they may cast any spell they see fit within the confines of their room.
	- If the party chooses to leave, they can travel to [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/Rules/Hex|hex 047]]. Go to [[#The Dragon]].
	- If they sleep here, move instead to [[#Next Morning]].

#### Secrets
- Casting [[Detect Magic]]:
	- **Alina** is using illusion magic (she actually is a [[Green Hag]] that the party might have met in [[The Withered Vale]])
	- The bookshelf contain multiple scrolls and books of magical nature (of all kind).
- Casting [[Detect Thoughts]]:
	- **Alina** is not trying to deceive the party - she wants the components requested not only for a spell, but also to make soup.
	- Even if the player "probes deeper" with the spell, **Alina** has no reason to attack the party and will just jest with her thoughts.
- Prying into her intensions with the dragon's meat reveals that **Alina** wants to make *Dragon Stew* and after she is certain the dragon has been slayed she will go collect the rest of the meat herself.

#### Next Morning
- what happens if they try to leave the room
- Aline tp to the dragon
