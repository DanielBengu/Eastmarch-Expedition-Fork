# Dungeons
Dungeons are any linear experience that contains one or more *rooms*. These *rooms* don't have to be actual rooms, made of stone brick with vaulted ceilings. They are a concept of rooms, and can be from a set of clearings in a forest, to rooms of a house. The idea of a dungeon is simply expressed to create linear play content that contains secrets and loot without a complete focus on role-play. With that being said, it is fully possible that the only way to clear a dungeon is to talk nicely to BBEG residing in it.

## Formatting a Dungeon
