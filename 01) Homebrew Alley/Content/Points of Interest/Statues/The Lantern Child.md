# The Lantern Child
> > A deep grey stone podium hosts the statue carved in the shape of a child. His stone hat resembles a paper boat, distorted by the wind. His clothes are rugged with holes in them, yet the boy smiles. A sightless smiles as you peer up into his eyes, and find empty sockets.
> > His left hand hold up a stone lantern, pointing it towards the horizon. The front of the lantern is open, and inside there seems to be a slot for something to go in it.
> > On the podium, a single sentence is etched in stone: *"Let me see"*

## Rewards
Solving the riddle grants the player the [[Boon|boon]] of [[True Sight]].

## Hints
- The statue has the writing *"Let me see"*
- ***[[Arcana]] DC 25.*** Reveals that the statue is imbued with Celestial and Demonic magic. Casting [[Detect Magic]] will give advantage to this roll and set the DC to 20.
- ***[[Investigation]] DC 15.*** Reveals some sort of hard yellowy substance near the slot in the child's lantern. On a critical success, it reveals that to be wax.
- ***[[Insight]] DC 10.*** Reveals the statue to have something to do with sight.

## Solving the Riddle
By placing a lit candle in the slot in the lantern, the players complete the riddle. Read the following:
> > To your horror, you see your friend's eyes glow alight as they spark in flames as soon as his hand is removed from the candle. Within the second, only smoke trails from now empty eye sockets.
> > The statue of the child seemingly blinks, and two stone eyes now occupy the previously empty space on his face.
> > In the meantime, strange tattoos are developing around your friend's empty eyes - marking them for having pleased the statue.

Then read to the player who received the [[Boon|boon]]:
> > You suddenly see everything clearly. Your surroundings are in perfect details as if shadows and darkness does not cloud your eyes.
> > Yet, something else is strange, your sight seemingly stops after 60ft. as if only the space beyond can only be occupied by the void.

- The player who placed the candle may choose to remove it, losing the [[Boon|boon]] and *taking 6 (1d8 + 2) radiant damage*.
- If another player tries to remove the candle, they suffer *23 (5d8 + 3) radiant damage* and must succeed a *Constitution Saving Throw DC 20* to be able to remove the candle. If they succeed, the original player looses the [[Boon|boon]] and gains their normal sight back.
- The candle cannot be extinguished by blowing on it or by magic means. If a PC tries to touch it, they suffer *6 (1d8 + 2) radiant damage*.

When the candle burns out of it's own accord, the statue crumbles and the [[Boon|boon]] cannot be removed.
Once the player with the [[Boon|boon]] dies, the crumbled statue seems to reconstruct from mist.
