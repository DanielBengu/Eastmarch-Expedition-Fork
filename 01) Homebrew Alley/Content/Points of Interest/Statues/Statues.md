# Statues
Statues on the island can take many forms and sizes. However, they all come with a riddle and a [[Boon|boon]].
The bravest of adventurers can test their wits to attempt to become stronger. However, no player may complete more than one challenge. If they do, [[Curses|curses]] are placed on the PC which may even result in an instant death.
