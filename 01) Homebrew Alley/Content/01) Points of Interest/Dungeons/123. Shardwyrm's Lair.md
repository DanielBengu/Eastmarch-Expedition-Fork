**NOTE:** This dungeon is still a TODO, what's below is an AI brainstorm of what the dungeon could be about, but it still needs a complete rewrite to better fit the campaign and the story narrated with the [[211. Kobolds' Mines]].
## The Dungeon Rooms

### The Entrance
> The path up Frostpeak is a graveyard of shrines. Cracked idols of Shardwyrm lie half-buried in snow, each one carved by trembling kobold hands. Offerings of frozen fish, crystals, and bones rest before them.  
> As you approach the summit, the wind howls a single phrase — a word in Draconic meaning _“Hunger.”_
> 
> At the mouth of a vast glacial cavern, a group of kobold zealots kneel before an altar of ice, pressing Frost Crystals into its cracks. Their scales shimmer faintly with frostbite and madness.

**Encounter:** 4–6 _Kobold Dragonshields_ and 1 _Kobold Ice Priest_ (custom: uses _Priest_ stat block with cold spells).  
They are performing a “feeding rite.” When interrupted, they attack in a frenzy, crying out, “He must feed!”

**Discovery:** If examined, the altar absorbs warmth, draining HP or spell slots over time. The crystals inside it pulse faintly toward the mountain’s heart — a clear trail leading deeper.

### The Puzzle
The tunnel ahead opens into a massive crevasse. Two broken ice bridges span it, suspended by thin spires of frozen wind. At the center floats a glowing Frost Crystal, humming like a heartbeat.

> As you step closer, the air becomes still. The bridge ripples underfoot, half-solid, half-dream. Runic lines glow faintly beneath the frost — the mark of draconic magic.

**Challenge:**  
The bridge only solidifies for creatures bearing a trace of draconic power.

- _Options:_
    
    - Speak Draconic words of command (Arcana or Insight DC 16).
        
    - Feed it a Frost Crystal (gained from Room 1).
        
    - Resist the pull of the storm and leap across (Athletics DC 18 or Fly).
        

Failure causes the bridge to partially collapse, triggering a **skill challenge** to save falling PCs (DEX saves DC 15 per round until rescued or stabilized).

Crossing the bridge safely attunes the party to the “heartbeat” of the lair — granting **resistance to cold** until the end of the dungeon.

### The Setback
> The tunnel opens into a cathedral of ice, lit from within by a thousand veins of glowing blue.  
> In its center lies an immense heart-shaped cluster of Frost Crystals, pulsing with light.  
> For a moment, you hear a voice inside your head — ancient, weary, cruel.  
> “You come… bearing warmth. I will take it.”

The **Heart of Frostpeak** is a fragment of Shardwyrm’s soul. It awakens as the players approach, summoning his defenders:

- 2 _Frost Elementals_ (use _Water Elemental_ with cold damage).
    
- 1 _Ice Mephit_ per PC, emerging from crystal cracks.
    

The fight is chaotic — shards explode on hit, reducing visibility and dealing cold splash damage. When the Heart drops to 0 HP, it doesn’t die — it **shatters**, sending out a shockwave that reveals the final passage.

**Twist:** The Heart isn’t destroyed — it’s _Sharydwrym’s phylactery_. The dragon _knows they’re here now._

### The Climax
> The last chamber is colossal — a hollow sphere of ice large enough to house a cathedral.  
> Spires of crystal rise from the floor and ceiling, meeting in arcs of frozen lightning.  
> At its center lies Shardwyrm — massive, majestic, fractured. His scales glow from within, as though lit by trapped souls. One eye burns with blue fire, the other weeps molten frost.  
> He doesn’t roar when he sees you. He sighs.  
> “Another wave come to take what I have built. You cannot unmake hunger.”

**The Battle:**

- Shardwyrm (Ancient White Dragon, 2024) with these alterations:
    
    - **Iceheart Phylactery:** When first slain, he reconstitutes from shattered crystal at half HP.
        
    - **Breath of Hunger:** Deals cold + psychic damage, freezing not flesh but _memories_. (Target loses 1 prepared spell or feature until rest.)
        
    - **Lair Actions:**
        
        - The floor becomes frictionless, forcing DEX saves to avoid sliding toward spikes.
            
        - Shards erupt from walls as _seeking missiles_ of ice.
            
        - The lair pulses with the dragon’s heartbeat, healing him slightly if crystals remain intact.
            

The party must either destroy the remaining Heart Fragments (environmental targets) or kill Shardwyrm twice to end his reign.

### The Resolution
When Shardwyrm dies, the Frost Crystals lose their glow. The mountain shakes, not from anger but release.  
Kobolds across Frostpeak drop to their knees in confusion as the link to their “god” is severed. Some wail; others wander away, lost.

> The cold light fades from the walls. For the first time, Frostpeak breathes warm air. The veins of ice dull to simple stone.  
> From the summit, you can see the mines below — fires going out, kobolds scattering into the snow.  
> The cycle is broken.

**Rewards:**

- Shardwyrm’s Hoard (as Ancient Dragon treasure) — includes relics of civilizations he consumed: frost-forged weapons, scrolls trapped in crystal, and one _Frost Crystal Heart_ (legendary crafting component).
    
- Permanent **Blessing of the Thaw** — immunity to cold and the ability to melt magical ice with touch (once per long rest).
    
- The Frostpeak Mines go dormant; kobolds disperse or seek new masters, opening new regional storylines.

## **Aftermath and Regional Consequences**

- The Frostpeak region warms slightly; blizzards lessen, revealing old roads and ruins.
    
- The kobolds’ departure opens access to deep sections of the mines — potential for _new dungeons_.
    
- If the dragon’s phylactery was left intact, faint whispers of his will linger in the wind. A future _Echo of Shardwyrm_ could rise, haunting the mountain again.
