# The Withered Vale
*A [[Green Hag]]'s quest for soup.*

## Cleared Dungeon
The dungeon is considered *cleared* if either [[#Nice Endings]] or [[#A Hug's Trick]] have been completed. If neither has been reached, do one of the following:
- If the dungeon was never explored before, start from [[#The Entrance]]
- If [[#The Climax]] has never been reached, start from [[#The Entrance]]
- If [[#The Climax]] has been completed, [[Green Hag|Alina]] remembers the original party she quested, which will result in either:
	- One of the members of the original party coming back with a [[Goblin Minion|goblin carcass]], go to [[#The Resolution]],
	- Or a new party of adventurers. If the latter, go to [[#A Hug's Surprise]]

### Cleared
If the dungeon has been cleared, any adventurer finds the [[#The Puzzle]], with the following differences:
1. There is no water in the bowl resting on the dais
2. There is no echo from the tunnels
3. Traveling any tunnel will bring you back from where you started without applying [[Exhaustion|exhausted]] or stealing your [[Rations]].

### A Hug's Surprise
The party moves forward through the dungeon as normal. However, they find 3 [[Green Hag|hags]] instead of [[#The Climax]] who attack the party immediately.
If the party defeats all 3 [[Green Hag|hags]], the dungeon is considered *cleared.*
#### Reward
- XP 5250 (to be divided evenly)
- 3 items from the Arcana Loot table in the DM's Guide at random.

## Scouting the Location
- From nearby [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hexes]], players can easily see a clearing in the forest,
- moving closer reveals the clearing to be formed from withered and dead plants.

## The Rooms
### The Entrance
> > As you enter the clearing, you notice more and more plants seem to be withered as you move towards the center.
> > As you carefully reach it, the ground slowly slant into a massive whole in the ground. It leads through a small dark cavern.

The whole is about *10ft.* in diameter and leads to a small cavern.
If a player enters the cavern, go to [[#The Puzzle]].

### The Puzzle
The cavern is in dim light from outside.
> > You enter the whole which quickly leads you to a vaulted chamber of wet stone.
> > Three narrow tunnels extend from the chamber, each ending in darkness.
> > At the chamber’s center stands a **polished stone dais**, slick with condensation and carved with a writing.
> > On the dais rests a **stone bowl filled with still water**.
> > The air hums softly — faint whispers echo down the tunnels.

The writing is a riddle in **Sylvan** and it reads:
> “Three paths whisper, three voices lie.  
> One hears truth, one hears cry,  
> One hears only what it wishes to.
> 
> Speak the truth aloud — but only once —  
> Or walk forever hearing none.”

Each tunnel is completely dark, and requires [[03) Backlink Glossary/Senses/Darkvision|Darkvision]] or a source of light to safely travel. Failing to do so slows down the travel down the path by 2d6 minutes.

#### Mechanics
- **Each tunnel has a distinct sound property:**
    - **Left Tunnel (Lament):** Echoes _alter_ what’s said — twisting words to sound fearful or false.  
    - **Middle Tunnel (Truth):** Echoes words back perfectly but _only_ if they are truthful. Lies return as warped or delayed sounds.
    - **Right Tunnel (Deception):** Echoes _flatter_ the speaker — returning their words as praise, regardless of meaning.
- The bowl of water on the dais **ripples** slightly whenever a lie is spoken in the cave, hinting that **truth affects the space**.
- If the party tries walking down a wrong tunnel:
    - They loop for 1d4 minutes before emerging back in the same chamber, disoriented and drained from energy. Each player that does so gets an [[Exhaustion|exhaustion level]].
    - Those who repeatedly lie or shout nonsense begin hearing faint laughter — the **hag’s distant amusement**.
- If the party tries to walk through the middle tunnel without solving the riddle they loop, loosing all of their [[Rations|rations]].

#### Solution
- The correct tunnel is the **middle one (Truth)**.
- To unlock the path, a party member must **speak a personal truth** — something painful or honest — into that tunnel.
- The echo will return perfectly.
- The bowl’s water stills completely, and the other tunnels vanish, revealing a **green-glowing archway** leading out to the withered valley.
> > The left and right tunnels silently collapse as two strokes of bright paint arc over the middle path. Light floods the room as the cave opens over a valley.
> > Theres a path going down the valley. From up here it looks easy to follow between all of the withered plants. You do so with your eyes, and see at the end of the valley, before the incline on the other side, a wooden hut stands alone. Plumes of smoke trail from its lonely chimney.

If the party decides to continue, go to [[#The Setback]].

### The Setback
> > You walk out into the light of day. Behind you the cave mouth to the small chamber, beyond it the path back over the surface.
> > You are below ground, yet the sun shines bright and hot.
> > Plants around you are withered or dead, tho no rotten smell emanates from them. The air is still as no wind seems to inhabit this valley.
> 
> > In front of you the valley extends downwards towards the hut, tiny in the distance. A path leads the way, twisting down the mountainside. Protecting you from the withered and dry plants.

#### Moving Forward
- If the players move forward on the path, go to [[#Dangerous Plants]]
- If the players try to explore, they find nothing of interest but dead plants.
	- If they try to move up the mountain, make them walk for about 30min before telling them that there is some resistance in the air preventing them from moving forward. If they insist, they can pass through with an [[Athletics]] DC 15. If they succeed, they leave the pocket dimension and are lost in the void. Those characters can be considered [[Dead|dead]].
	- When the players are done exploring and moving towards the hut, go to [[#Dangerous Plants]]

#### Dangerous Plants
As the players travel trough the path, read the following, they get attacked by (player number) of [[Animated Grove]]s. Any player who is not looking out for danger is [[Surprise|surprised]].

When all of the constructs have been dispatched, read the following:
> > "He he he he", you hear a strange laugh in the air.
> > "Yes - yes - you would do me just fine. Please come forward I am waiting for you."

Options:
- If the players decide to continue, go to [[#The Climax]].
- If the players choose to turn back, the [[Green Hag|hag]] calls after them to reconsider, and that she is not a threat.

### The Climax
> > You reach a small wooden hut at the bottom of the valley. A familiar smell of spices fills the air.
> > As you step closer, the door opens revealing a cozy interior with a huge pot simmering in the fireplace.
> > A wrinkled green figure stands over the door, looking over you.
> > "Hmmmm - I was hoping you would have a little more muscle to you, but you will do. I've also been told I should tell you when I am not trying to eat you, as you mortals may be a little skeptic about my kind."
> > A *deep* breath.
> > "I am **not** trying to eat you. However, I do need ingredients for my soup, if you would mind stepping in, I would gladly explain to you my deal."

If the players step inside to hear her out, read the following:
> > As you step inside, you notice the room is illuminated by dancing lights. The green hag grabs a stool from near the fire, and sits herself down.
> > "I need the tasty - *tasty* - carcass of a goblin. How you procure it, is not my problem. I have friends visiting soon, who will want to stay a while, and I would love to prepare them a *niiice soup.* However, I did not have time to hunt for the ingredients myself. I am willing to offer you a **contract** for you to bring me back the carcass. I promise to let the person who brings me the carcass come in and out of here unscathed and reward them with a scroll of my making."

The hut contains a single [[Green Hag]] called *Alenia* who offers the character a deal:
- She wants the character to bring in a [[Goblin Minion|goblin]] corpse for her stew
- She needs to prepare a *banquet* for two of her friends which will be coming to visit
- She is willing to offer a scroll of [[Animate Grove]]

#### Secrets
- [[Green Hag|Alenia]]'s contract wording is specific and is for a single PC to bring the carcass - she made no promise to not hurt the rest of the accompanying party.
- She is a Fay of the [[Seelie Court]] and therefore will honor the contract made.

#### Loot
A successful [[Stealth]] DC 20 (if [[Green Hag|Alenia]] is alive), or a [[Investigation]] DC 10 (if she's not), reveal the following items in the hut:
- The hut contains 15 [[Rations]],
- 3 scrolls of [[Animate Grove]],
- and a Rope of Mending (from the DM's guide)

#### Moving Forward
[[Green Hag|Alenia]] allows the players to leave her valley without problems, marking down the adventurers who came in to remember them.
When any of these adventurers come back, they can safely traverse the valley to her hut, go to [[#The Resolution]].

### The Resolution
> > The familiar smell of stew simmers just across the door, where you can hear three distinct voices talking and laughing.

If a single player came down here with the [[Goblin Minion|carcass]], go to [[#Nice Endings]]. Otherwise, go to [[#A Hug's Trick]].

#### Nice Endings
When the player tries to communicate or knock on the door:
> > The door opens revealing Alenia standing in front of you. She looks over your shoulders, and not seeing anyone, you can see a smirk of annoyance crossing her expression.
> > "I can see you brought your price from the hunt - please give me a second."
> > She walks back in, and soon after emerges with a scroll in her hands.
> > "Here's your payment - and now shuu - we have dinner to prepare"

##### Rewards
The player is allowed to leave with a scroll of [[Animate Grove]].
Each player in the original plus the members of the current party (waiting outside) receive XP 200 for resolving the issue non violently.

#### A Hug's Trick
> > "I can smell DIIIINNER" you hear Alenia's voice shout in the hut.
> > The door quickly opens and you are faced with a grin stamped on a deformed green face.

She hands the player holding the goblin a scroll of [[Animate Grove]] before using a [[Teleport]] scroll to send the out of the cave (on [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|Hex]] *532*). If she succeed, she [[Teleport|teleports]] back and read the following:
> > "GIIIRLS is now time to collect our desert!"

If she failed at teleporting the character, read the following:
> > "GIIRLS dinner is served - and desert is to be collected. Remember to leave the pretty one alive!"

There are 3 [[Green Hag]]s in the hut which will attack the players but **not** the player that brought in the carcass even if that player attacks them.

##### Defeating the Hags
Defeating 2 of the Hags result in the following loot (the final [[Green Hag|hag]] teleports away):
- All loot from [[#Loot]],
- XP 5250 (to be divided evenly)

##### Player Deaths
If all the players but the one die, one of the surviving [[Green Hag|hags]] [[Teleport|teleports]] the player to [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|Hex]] *532* (assume the teleportation roll to always succeed), then will [[Teleport|teleport]] back to the hut.
