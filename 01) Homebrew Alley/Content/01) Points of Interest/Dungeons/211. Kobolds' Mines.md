# Kobolds' Mines

*Heroes' first ~~and maybe last~~ journey, exploring the insides of the mines of Frostpeak.*
Location: Hex 211

## Short Description

*A tribe of Frost Kobolds has been spotted near the base of Frostpeak, guarding the entrance of what appears to be a mine that extends to the insides of the Frostpeak mountain. *

### Current Status

There's no public knowledge about any party that has managed to reach the insides of the mines, *yet*.

## Scouting the Location
- From nearby [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hexes]], players can see the entrance of the mines at the base of the mountain, and the camp made of simple wood structures of Kobolds that guards it outside

---

## The Dungeon Rooms
### The Entrance
> > You reach the base of the Frostpeak mountain, rumored to be the nest of a dangerous cold beast.
> > A wooden camp guards the entrance of the mines, a makeshift palisade and an unmanned watchtower is all that you can see from the outside, except for two azure-scaled Kobolds guarding the open entrance of the camp, one of which is chomping down on a river fish, while the other watches, hungry and jealous. Their attention is so focused on the food that they don't seem to have spotted you yet.
> > ![[Hungry Frost Kobold.png|300]]

The two kobolds will remain distracted until the players reveal themselves to them, in which case they will begin screaming to alert the other kobolds inside the camp, before either fighting the players if they are close enough, or run inside the camp if they're still far when they reveal themselves. (see [[#Camp Fight]])
The only exception to this scenario is if one of the characters revealed is a White [[Dragonborn]], in which case the kobolds will start speaking in Draconic, asking the purpose of the visit.(see [[#Dragonborn's Choice]])


#### Dragonborn's Choice

The Dragonborn will be able to either persuade or intimidate them into granting access to the mines, but the kobolds are wary of the strangers accompanying the Dragonborn and will ask the reason of their presence.
After the Dragonborn answers the question the player will roll for either Persuasion or Intimidation, with a DC of 1 + 4 for each member of the party that's not a Dragonborn of Cold and doesn’t appear to be a prisoner or underling of the Dragonborn from the Kobolds’ point of view
The roll will be made with Advantage if the Dragonborn mentions bringing any kind of sacrifice or offering to [[Shardwyrm of the Frostpeak]], the dragon that residues in the summit of the mountain, and the same dragon that these kobolds venerate (the party doesn't have to know the name of the Dragon, mentioning it is enough).
If the Dragonborn doesn't speak Draconic or fails the roll, the Kobolds will attack them, calling the other kobolds inside the camp as reinforcement ([[#Camp Fight]]).
If the Dragonborn manages to convince them to let the party pass, they will accompany the party until the mine's entrance, telling the other kobolds in the camp to stand down in Draconic ([[#The Puzzle]]).
They will not accompany the party inside the mines, stating that their overseer will punish them if he finds out they left the camp unmanned.

#### Sneak inside
The wood palisade is hastily made and the players can easily find an entrance in either side of it, with an Investigation check of 5 DC. 
Anyone who enters must roll a stealth check of 10 DC to remain hidden from the other distracted kobolds inside the camp. 
If any of them fails, the closest Kobold will come investigate the sounds and will alert the others as soon as he finds someone, starting the [[#Camp Fight]].

#### Camp Fight
There are 6 [[Frost Kobold]] guarding the camp, two outside the gates (1), one in the tent (5) storing some supplies inside the storage crates, one is sitting beside the campfire, either preparing it for the night if it's still daytime, or relaxing by the fire if it's nighttime, while the last two are arguing and playfighting in the Pit (4).
If the party manages to defeat the Kobolds, they can enter the mines (see [[#The Puzzle]]).
The kobolds are mischievous creatures that prefer hit-and-run strategies, and have deployed a couple of traps inside the camp that the players will need avoid (TODO)
If the party clears the encounter, they receive 50XP each.

### The Puzzle

> > You finally manage to enter the mines, and the tunnel leads you to a circular room that looks like a storage area for mined ice crystals. Shattered crystal dust is accumulated in big piles around the room. When you try to pick up a handfull of dust, it falls between your fingers like fine sand. After the storage area you reach a workshop, with a couple of simple workbenches filled with metal scraps, wood and ice crystals. The next room looks like a barrack, a lot of wool beds on the floor around a campfire that is still lit, with another tunnel that seems to lead to the heart of the mountain. ([[#The Rooms]])
> > After a couple of minutes of navigating through the mine tunnels, the party reaches a crossroads of two tunnels, going almost the opposite direction from one another, with a icy wall inbetween, dividing the two roads.
> > On the icy wall, a crooked wooden sign is nailed haphazardly. The letters are poorly written, jagged, uneven, and carved by a shaky hand into the frostbitten wood.

```
THE KRISTAL TЯEZURY IS THIS WAY  -->
```

![[Mountain Mines.png|500]]

#### The Rooms

There's no particular puzzle or ambush inbetween these rooms, the players can navigate and explore them as they please until they are ready to continue to the real puzzle ([[#THE KRISTAL TЯEZURY IS THIS WAY -->]]).
If they try to pick up and store some ice crystal dust, it will melt as soon as they leave the mountain. The metal scraps and wood they find have no particular economic value. They can briefly rest and prepare around the campfire but if they take more than 4 hours, they will be attacked by another group of 4 [[Frost Kobold]] that came from the inside of the mountain to substitute the patrol outside.

#### THE KRISTAL TЯEZURY IS THIS WAY -->

The Kobolds are very mischievous and having an intelligence of 8 and a wisdom of 7 will not stop them from trying to outsmart and trick you. 
They have prepared a very cunning trap in which they want the players to go this way ->, where a big empty room with a singular chest at the end of it awaits them. The chest has another extremely witty signpost trap above it that reads "THE KRISTAL TREZURY IS INZIDE THE ~~MIMIC~~ CHEST" with the word "mimic" written in draconic and barred.
If the party gets outwitted by the kobolds and tries to open the chest, surprise!!! The chest was a [[Mimic]]!! He will start chomping on the player that opened the chest, as described by the creature sheet, and engage the party in fight. 
After the scene, the party can hear laugh and snarky insults in draconic being thrown at them from behind the ice walls ("ZTUPID KREATUREZ!!").

Whenever the players decide to go <- this way (either by realizing the trap, or after the mimic scene), they reach [[#The Setback]].

### The Setback

> > After another couple minutes of marching, the tunnel slopes down into a glittern cavern.
> > The air feels heavy, charged with cold magic. Along the walls runs a wide vein of translucent blue ice shot through with silvery ore: the frost veins.
> > This must be what the Kobolds are mining, a magically active mineral that resonates extremely well with cold magic, but precisely *why* are they mining it?
> > As you enter the cavern, you can hear some whispers in draconic in the walls, and you can see a single Kobold appear behind a small hole in the wall ice. He's holding a blue bomb in his hand, already lit, and with a short maniacal laugh the Kobold throws and detonates the bomb against one the support beams of the cavern, making it crumble down.
> > The ground starts _shaking_, the vein _fractures_ and the ice begins to _shatter from within_, releasing violent cold energy and creating collapsing ice chunks, one of which collapses right behind you on the entrance of the cavern, closing it indefinitely.
> > You will *not* last long here.

![[Frostpeak Mines.png|500]]

After you read the scenario, start a timer of 10 minutes and leave it on for the players to see.
There are three main exits to this scenario the players can find:

#### 1. **The Collapsed Tunnel (Strength/Teamwork route)**

A partial cave-in blocks the main way back. The players can clear a crawl-space through sheer grit.

- **Checks:** STR (Athletics) DC 15 that can be rolled once per minute, if multiple people try they designate a player to roll with [[Advantage]]. 4 Succesfull checks are needed to clear the crawlspace
    
- **Outcome:**:

> > After some clawing against the ice block you manage to clear a small crawl-space, big just enough to let you all crawl back to the tunnel you came from. While you are all regaining your breath, the shaking becomes more and more violent until you hear the entire cavern collapse onto itself, sealing it forever. You have enough time to recover the initial shock and to start going back the tunnel, when around half-way through you notice a small entrance from a side of the wall that wasn't really visible from the way-in, leading you to another section of the cave ([[#The Climax]])
    

#### 2. **The Frozen Shaft (Dexterity/Resourcefulness route)**

After two minutes has passed a crack expands on the ceiling and a big chunk of ice falls from it to one of the sides of the cavern. If one of the players lands a perception check of 15 after that moment they spot a shaft that was initially covered from the block near the junction between wall and ceiling.

- **Checks:** DEX (Acrobatics) with DC 15 that can be rolled once per minute to climb inside the shaft. Items can be used to help themselves or other players inside the shaft.
    
- **Outcome:**
- 
> > The inside of the shaft is extremely dark and cold, you feel like no one has passed through this tunnel for a long time. While you try to crawl into the unknown, you fall into a descending tunnel that makes you crash through a wall of ice and reach a new room full of Kobolds that scream surprised and scared by the sudden noise and appareance ([[#The Climax]])

#### 3. **The Hidden Tunnel (Investigation route)**
Every minute, one of the players can roll to check alongside the walls for a hidden exit
- **Checks**: Investigation DC 15 that can be rolled once per minute to find the hidden wall

- **Outcome:**
> > After looking alongside the walls, you notice one section where the wall is more hollow than the rest, and after some pounding you manage to break a hole into it, creating a small exit.

#### 4. **The Kobold Crawlspace (failsafe)**

After 8 minutes has passed, as the cavern quakes, a small kobold worker seems to be thrown in the middle of the cave from one of the holes in the wall, terrified and bound with rope. You seem to notice that he's very scared and seems to be screaming something towards the other Kobolds in the walls (If someone speaks draconic they understand that the worker is saying something like "Please free me! Don't punish me for delays in production, it was not my fault, the vein was very tough!") ([[#The Climax]])

- **Checks:** Athletics DC 10, if failed it takes a minute to free the Kobold
    
- **Outcome:**
> > The Kobold starts to feel around the wall until it finds a section that feels more empty than the rest. It takes out its dagger and starts to pound at the wall until it breaks an opening big enough to let all of you pass inside. You just barely manage to enter the opening when the ground starts shaking violently and the entire cavern below you collapses onto intself, sealing you inside this tunnel with only a little Kobold worker to help you navigate it. After what seems like an eternity, you reach a new room ([[#The Climax]])

### The Climax

(Give 100 XP to each player for the previous section)

> > The players reach the final cavern: a vast, glittering chamber where kobolds hack ice-crystals from the walls. 
> > At the center: **Grisshar**, a half-dragon three times their size, snow-white scales streaked with blue veins of magic. He’s shouting orders, tail slamming, wings twitching in irritation.
> > He looks very strong, but your presence doesn't seem to make him hostile towards you, he looks more... annoyed by the circumstance.
> > The players arrive right as the final cart behind Grisshar is being filled and dragged toward a shaft leading upward.
> > You notice that the shaft where the mine disappeared into has lights coming from above, snow dust swiftly coming inside the cavern from there, and a cold and fresh breeze instantly make you understand that the tunnel leads to outside the mountain, and in particular, the peak of it.
> > Grisshar looks at you, menacingly, and asks: 
> > *What are you doing here? You are interrupting important work, I won't tolerate delays!*


Grisshar’s job is to **extract as many crystals as possible** before [[Shardwyrm of Frostpeak|Shardwyrm]] freezes him for failure.  
The players’ presence is an **inconvenience** to the operation, and the sooner they leave the mine, the sooner the kobolds can return to work.

He’s cruel, intelligent, but pragmatic. He doesn’t want a fight that wastes time or damages the mine.

#### Fight Grisshar

The players can fight [[Grisshar]] (TODO: prepare a custom sheet for Grisshar with dynamic stats based on the party level) and the kobolds ([[Frost Kobold]]) to kill him. 
They may try to rally the Kobolds to their side first (only with a persuasion check of DC 13), and if they're successfull the kobolds will take arms and join the fight (roll 1d4 + 3 to check how many will join alongside the party. The rest will flee away).

#### Deal with Grisshar

The players may notice that Grisshar doesn't really care about the adventurers, and their presence it's just an annoyance and a delay for him. Fighting them will probably waste a lot of time that Grisshar doesn't have. They may try to bargain with Grisshar to leave the premise for a little fortune. 
Grisshar offers them a shiny [[Ice Crystal]] each to leave the dungeon through the entrance to the side. Players can bargain for a more substantially reward, with a Persuasion or Intimidation check of 20 DC (Advantage if they use Grisshar's fear of [[Shardwyrm of Frostpeak]] against him). If the check is passed, Grisshar points at one of the workbenches around the room, where players can spot some weapons made with Ice Crystal, and offers them to take one in addition to the Crystals (they are copies of the basic version of the weapon, but with an additional +1 Cold damage).
He quickly warns the party to stop pushing their luck if they try to ask for even more rewards, and start a fight if they keep insisting.

### The Resolution

The dungeon's ending depends mainly on whether the party decided to fight and kill Grishar, or whether they took the deal and left

#### Grisshar is dead
> > After a gruesome fight the half-dragon drops to the ground in a pool of blood that seems to freeze shortly after. The Kobolds are shocked at the situation: the overseer that tormented them dropped dead in front of them. But if the overseer was an herald of their true lord, what's gonna happen now? Many of them will follow the ones that ran earlier through the tunnels, screaming in Draconic.
> > Some of the more opportunistic ones quickly take whatever they can find of value in the room before scattering, leaving the party only a single shiny [[Ice Crystal]] and one Ice Crystal item for each member of the party (you can choose whether it's random or the item that's more helpfull for that player).
> > After looting whatever remained, the party leaves the mountain by a side tunnel that lead them straight to the outside. Each member takes a couple of minutes to regain their breath, look at their new gear, and then prepare for the next step.

#### Deal taken
> > At the end of the adventure, the mines remain operational, and Kobolds still mine the Ice Crystals for their overlord. But you are now aware of Grisshar, who handles the operations inside the mine, and that the real boss of Frostpeak lies above, in the summit of the mountain, accumulating piles of Ice Crystals, but *why*?
> > That's not an answer that the party will receive for now, as you prepare to leave the area you feel lucky to be still alive after everything you went through. You think about your next move...


## Dungeon's storyline
Grisshar is only one of the many half-dragons under the command of [[Shardwyrm of Frostpeak]], that will be quickly replaced when killed.
Everytime the dungeon gets completed and the Overseer is dead, the mines stays empty for a real-time week, and after that a new wave of [[Frost Kobold]] and a new Overseer takes the place of the previous one.
The only way to stop this cycle is to kill Shardwyrm itself, by completing the [[123. Shardwyrm's Lair]] dungeon.
