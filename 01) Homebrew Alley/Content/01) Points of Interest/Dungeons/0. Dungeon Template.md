## The Dungeon Rooms

### The Entrance
- This is the introduction of the dungeon and the first step to it. 
- The first room of the dungeon should answer the question "*Why hasn’t someone already cleared this dungeon? What danger or barrier guards it?*"
- Put a simple fight here that starts the narrative for the players. It will make them understand what's the general situation and what kind of monsters/creatures are they going to encounter in this dungeon.
- If you prefer to have the party clear a puzzle first before fighting, you can swap this room with [[#The Puzzle]]
- Example:
  > > The party reaches what appears to be the entrance of a large cave hidden by the plants around it. 
  > > A stony figure stands out in the middle of the entrance, covered in moss. It looks like it hasn't moved for a long time.
  > > As soon as you come near it you see a flash appear in its eyes, a faint amber glow that pulses once… then again, brighter. The sound of grinding stone echoes through the clearing as flakes of moss and dust crumble from its body.
  > > The golem’s chest splits open slightly, revealing veins of dimly glowing runes that flare to life like embers being fed air. Its fingers twitch, scraping against each other with the sound of shifting boulders.  
  > > The ground trembles as it takes its first step forward in centuries, each movement shedding more debris until its true shape is revealed: a massive guardian carved from the cave’s very walls. The air grows thick with ancient magic, the runes on its arms and chest burning brighter as its gaze locks on the party.  
  > > With a final, thunderous exhale of dust, it raises its stone fists. The runes flare blindingly, and the cave entrance seals behind it in a cascade of falling rock.  
  > > The guardian speaks in a grinding, hollow tone that vibrates in your bones:  
  > > “**Intruders. The sanctum sleeps no more.**”  
  > > Roll for Initiative.

### The Puzzle
- If we consider the Entrance and its fight to be a physical obstacle, this room represents a mental one.
- The party encounters a puzzle that bars further progress., which can be needing to find a hidden key for the door, start a special ritual, or just having to find the hidden entrance to the next section of the dungeon.
- This room can be exchanged with the Entrance based on your scenario (maybe the players needs to first gain access to the door that leads to the dungeon with a special key, and inside that door a group of skeletons guards the place)
- Example:
> > After the guardian falls, a hidden door opens to a round stone chamber. Three monoliths stand in a triangle, each carved with runes of _sound_, _light_, and _water_. When the party makes noise, the runes glow faintly in different colors.
> > A short inscription reads in Common : _“Echo, light, and life in harmony.”_

### The Setback
- The party has managed to clear the initial minor obstacles, and now the first major one appears.
- The purpose of this room is to make the players' progress temporarily halt or even regress, by putting them against a difficult situation they need to clear.
- It can be another fight, it can be a trap of some sort, or a puzzle, it doesn't matter.
- If you are preparing this dungeon with a central theme or twist in mind, this is the best place to act on it (for example, if you're inspired to make a Crypt dungeon, put some skeleton here with a Necromancer raising them. If you want a social betrayal scene, put a curse that forces your players one against the others, and so on).
- Example:
> > As the final hum of the monoliths fades, the stone door grinds open, revealing a narrow corridor lit by a faint, golden glow. The walls here seem alive; subtly moving, breathing almost, the stone rippling like liquid under torchlight.
> > The air grows heavier with each step. Then, with a deep rumble, the passage twists. The floor tilts, the walls slide, and in an instant, what was a straight path becomes a maze of shifting stone.
> > Echoes bounce in impossible directions. You glimpse your companions for a moment before a wall slides between you. The light flickers and fades, leaving only the sound of grinding rock and the faint pulse of magic deep below.

### The Climax
- Simply put: the boss fight.
- This room's purpose is to be the grand finale of your dungeon, the last obstacle before the reward.
- Most commonly here will be a final boss that your party wants to defeat to reach the treasure, but you can add some twists to it if you want to make it more special: maybe the boss is open to a deal with the players, or a third party intervenes in the fight, either as allies or enemies.
- The final challenge should test everything they’ve learned or endured in the previous rooms: the skills, clues, or choices that brought them here.
- It doesn't need to be a straight up boss fight but it needs to be something big and memorable that the players will enjoy defeating.
- Example:
> > The twisting corridors converge into a vast cavern bathed in a pale, inner light. At its center stands a massive crystal heart suspended in midair, encased in veins of living rock that pulse with energy. The air hums with power; ancient, rhythmic, and heavy.
> > The fragments of the fallen golem’s runes flicker along the cavern floor, drawn toward the crystal like iron filings to a magnet. The heart stirs, the stone veins tightening as a towering form begins to emerge: not a single guardian, but the essence that once animated them all.
> > The chamber trembles. The crystal pulses like a heartbeat. The final trial has awakened.

### The Resolution
- This is the end of the dungeon, the players have managed to clear it and **it's now time to conclude the story and reap the rewards**.
- If you want a final twist you can decide to add some minor complications like traps on the chests, or a mimic.
- **The players are now exhausted** (_in-game_ and _in real life_ as well) from the previous encounters, **so avoid major obstacles here**: the resolution should feel like *closure*, not punishment. If the party dies because of a secret second final boss that appears here, ==they will feel cheated out==.
- Make the players retrieve the loot, add a complication if you want a final little twist, finish the story and make the party leave the dungeon.
- If you want to continue the story behind this dungeon in another one, you may want to add some hints and hooks for the players here, so that they know there's still something to do about this.
- Example:
> > When the last echo of battle fades, the crystal heart dims, its light softening into a steady glow. 
> > The rock veins loosen and retract, reshaping into gentle curves of natural stone, but not before uncovering a little room with an altar in the middle of it, showing some engravings to the side of it, and a _**crystal shaped dagger**_ that seems to reflect light planted on top of it.
> > A soft wind moves through the chamber, the first sign of air in what felt like a tomb. The cave seems to breathe again. 
> > Where the crystal once hung, a small opening now leads upward, sunlight spilling through cracks in the ceiling.
> > The same voice that once warned you now whispers faintly from the walls:
> > “**_The way is open. The sanctum remembers._**”
> > The oppressive weight of the place lifts, leaving behind quiet, ancient peace, and the sense that something deep beneath the mountain _still watches_.
