# Dungeon Name

*It seems like there was a big fight here, lot of blood splattered around the area, and something was left behind...*
Location: hex 388

### Current Status

No party has approached the encounter yet.

## Short Description

_Last night a group of lookouts saw two big creatures fight in the other side of the river, towards the direction of the Frostpeak mountain._

## Scouting the Location
From nearby [[01) Homebrew Alley/Content/04) Rules/Hex|hexes]], players can see what seems the remains of a big fight: trees broken in half, a couple of boulders seems to have big holes in them, and the area is splattered with blood and a weird dark-green substance that can't really be discerned from afar.

## The Dungeon Rooms

### The Entrance
> > The party arrives at the edge of a wide, open field, or what _used to be_ one.
> > 
> > The ground is torn apart by colossal footprints and gouges where enormous fists must have struck. Trees lie uprooted and splintered like matchsticks, their trunks soaked in drying blood. Jagged boulders have been cracked open and left on the battlefield.
> > The air is thick with the smell of iron and rot. The grass, once green, is now painted in broad streaks of two colors: a dark, oily green-black that smolders faintly in the morning light, and a heavy clay-red that has already begun to harden into crusted patches of soil.
> > 
> > The wind is still. Even the crows keep their distance.
> > Whatever happened here was no ordinary battle. The scale of destruction makes one thing clear: giants walked this field last night.
> > 
> > In the very center of the devastation you see something that looks alive, a dark-green object the size of a log that keeps twitching every once in a while.

A fight between a [[Hill Giant]] and a [[Troll]] broke here the night before, and the Giant removed the arm from the body of the Troll and left it there, leaving a [[Troll Limb]] that will remain alive until 24 hours have passed. 
Players can roll Investigation to discover the following information:
- If they don't specify what they're looking for, a Perception with DC 10 will make them discover that the hints of the fight suggest that two Giant-sized creatures fought here, with a DC of 15 they discover that the two bloods are of a Giant and a Troll.
- If they want to analyze a piece of surrounding to discover what caused it (like the broken trees), a Investigation DC 5 makes them understand that two Giant-sized creatures fought here.
- If they want to analyze the blood, a Investigation DC 10 will make them discover that the two bloods are of a Giant and a Troll.
- If they want to understand where did the creatures go, only a Perception NAT 20 will uncover the two different set of footprints they each took.
- If they want to analyze the green object from afar, a Nature DC 15 makes them discover the object is a [[Troll Limb]] still alive.
- If they approach the [[Troll Limb]] and enter within 20ft of it, it will attack the party. Describe it like this:
  > > As the party draws closer, the green mass shudders. What looked like a lump of flesh or moss begins to coil in on itself, muscles tightening beneath torn skin. The air fills with a wet, fibrous sound, like raw meat being wrung out. 
  > > In an instant, it lurches upright, revealing the shape of a severed limb, its fingers flexing with unnatural precision. The thing drags itself forward in jerking, predatory motions, leaving streaks of dark ichor across the ground. Each twitch grows faster, more violent, until the limb propels itself in a grotesque leap straight toward the nearest warm body.
> >
> >_**Roll for initiative**_.

After the players defeat the Arm they will discover the two set of footprints (if they haven't yet), one of the Hill Giant leading towards the mountains in the north east (hex 323), and one of the Troll leading towards the forest (hex 389). Both of the footprints have a trail of the respective blood on them, indicating that the two creatures are weakened by the fight.
If the players follow any of them, move to [[#The Puzzle]].

### The Puzzle
Players can follow either the Giant footprints or the Troll ones
> > Following the enormous footprints into the forest, the party finds the land growing steadily more brutalized. Trees lean at _unnatural_ angles, their trunks scraped raw where something massive brushed past. Boulders are cracked, their interiors smeared with blood and hair. The path smells of iron and damp moss.
> > 
> > Eventually, the forest opens into a wide hollow beneath a cliffside. The earth here has been scooped out into something resembling a den: a nest made of uprooted trees, massive pelts, and crushed stone. Bones the size of logs are piled along one edge, many snapped in half as though chewed. The air is humid and heavy, buzzing faintly with flies.
> > 
> > In the center of the den stands a rough, human-shaped mound of stone. It towers nearly fifteen feet tall, its surface pitted and streaked with dried blood and pollen. From a distance it looks like a crude idol or war-trophy. Closer inspection reveals what might once have been a carved face, though erosion — or deliberate blows — have reduced it to a grotesque suggestion of features.
> > Scattered around the figure are broken boulders and giant-sized trinkets: bits of jewelry, torn banners, and the remnants of a clay pot filled with wilted flowers. One side of the statue has been struck repeatedly, the marks fresh and deep — as if something with claws tried to gouge out its “eyes.”
> > 
> > Anyone examining the scene feels the weight of obsession. Whatever lives here clearly worships or mourns this thing. The area hums faintly, the echo of giant footsteps rolling through the trees.

### The Setback
- The party has managed to clear the initial minor obstacles, and now the first major one appears.
- The purpose of this room is to make the players' progress temporarily halt or even regress, by putting them against a difficult situation they need to clear.
- It can be another fight, it can be a trap of some sort, or a puzzle, it doesn't matter.
- If you are preparing this dungeon with a central theme or twist in mind, this is the best place to act on it (for example, if you're inspired to make a Crypt dungeon, put some skeleton here with a Necromancer raising them. If you want a social betrayal scene, put a curse that forces your players one against the others, and so on).
- Example:
> > As the final hum of the monoliths fades, the stone door grinds open, revealing a narrow corridor lit by a faint, golden glow. The walls here seem alive; subtly moving, breathing almost, the stone rippling like liquid under torchlight.
> > The air grows heavier with each step. Then, with a deep rumble, the passage twists. The floor tilts, the walls slide, and in an instant, what was a straight path becomes a maze of shifting stone.
> > Echoes bounce in impossible directions. You glimpse your companions for a moment before a wall slides between you. The light flickers and fades, leaving only the sound of grinding rock and the faint pulse of magic deep below.

### The Climax
- Simply put: the boss fight.
- This room's purpose is to be the grand finale of your dungeon, the last obstacle before the reward.
- Most commonly here will be a final boss that your party wants to defeat to reach the treasure, but you can add some twists to it if you want to make it more special: maybe the boss is open to a deal with the players, or a third party intervenes in the fight, either as allies or enemies.
- The final challenge should test everything they’ve learned or endured in the previous rooms: the skills, clues, or choices that brought them here.
- It doesn't need to be a straight up boss fight but it needs to be something big and memorable that the players will enjoy defeating.
- Example:
> > The twisting corridors converge into a vast cavern bathed in a pale, inner light. At its center stands a massive crystal heart suspended in midair, encased in veins of living rock that pulse with energy. The air hums with power; ancient, rhythmic, and heavy.
> > The fragments of the fallen golem’s runes flicker along the cavern floor, drawn toward the crystal like iron filings to a magnet. The heart stirs, the stone veins tightening as a towering form begins to emerge: not a single guardian, but the essence that once animated them all.
> > The chamber trembles. The crystal pulses like a heartbeat. The final trial has awakened.

### The Resolution
- This is the end of the dungeon, the players have managed to clear it and **it's now time to conclude the story and reap the rewards**.
- If you want a final twist you can decide to add some minor complications like traps on the chests, or a mimic.
- **The players are now exhausted** (_in-game_ and _in real life_ as well) from the previous encounters, **so avoid major obstacles here**: the resolution should feel like *closure*, not punishment. If the party dies because of a secret second final boss that appears here, ==they will feel cheated out==.
- Make the players retrieve the loot, add a complication if you want a final little twist, finish the story and make the party leave the dungeon.
- If you want to continue the story behind this dungeon in another one, you may want to add some hints and hooks for the players here, so that they know there's still something to do about this.
- Example:
> > When the last echo of battle fades, the crystal heart dims, its light softening into a steady glow. 
> > The rock veins loosen and retract, reshaping into gentle curves of natural stone, but not before uncovering a little room with an altar in the middle of it, showing some engravings to the side of it, and a _**crystal shaped dagger**_ that seems to reflect light planted on top of it.
> > A soft wind moves through the chamber, the first sign of air in what felt like a tomb. The cave seems to breathe again. 
> > Where the crystal once hung, a small opening now leads upward, sunlight spilling through cracks in the ceiling.
> > The same voice that once warned you now whispers faintly from the walls:
> > “**_The way is open. The sanctum remembers._**”
> > The oppressive weight of the place lifts, leaving behind quiet, ancient peace, and the sense that something deep beneath the mountain _still watches_.
