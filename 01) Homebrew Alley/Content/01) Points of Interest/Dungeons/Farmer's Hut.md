# Farmer's Hut

*The hut of a simple farmer that recently had an unlucky encounter*
Location: TBD (near acampment, in a tile adjacent to a river, like 537 or 388)

## Short Description

*There's a farmer known by the community that hasn't been seen for a little while, I hope he's okay...*

### Current Status

==**NOT OPEN YET**==, some time needs to pass from the start of the campaign so that Owlguard Landing grows enough for a NPC to try and start a farm outside it.

## Scouting the Location
There's a normal farm with a hut, nothing out of the ordinary.

## The Dungeon Rooms

### The Entrance
> > The players arrive at a lonely farm at dusk. The wheat fields are black silhouettes against a red sky. The house door is ajar, and faint groaning drifts out between gusts of wind.  
Inside, the one-room hut is a mess of overturned furniture and dried blood. 
> > The farmer, gaunt, pale, with veins of black rot creeping up his neck, stands near the fireplace. Half of his face is still human; the other half twitches and spasms with undeath.  
> > When he notices the party, his eyes flicker between recognition and hunger. He mutters the word “_run_”… then the curse takes over.  
> >  **Roll for initiative.**

The players have the choice to either kill the farmer, or just knock him out.
If the party kills him (at any point), jump straight to [[#Farmer is Dead]].
If the party manages to defeat the farmer without killing him, they will have a couple of minutes of time to decide what to do. After that time has passed, move onto [[#The Puzzle]].

### The Puzzle
After the players knock the farmer out, they have a couple of minutes to decide what to do. In that time, the farmer is regenerating the wounds received, and after a couple of minutes all wounds are healed and he's ready to stand back up again and attack the party another time.

> > The wounds close as if time itself reversed. The farmer gasps and lurches forward again, driven by something deep beneath the floor. The glowing symbols pulse with each heartbeat he takes.

If the players knock him out cold, they need to find a way to stop the regeneration, or restrict him in a way that lets them continue the adventure without the constant attacks. If they do, pass into [[#The Setback]]

### The Setback
- The party has managed to clear the initial minor obstacles, and now the first major one appears.
- The purpose of this room is to make the players' progress temporarily halt or even regress, by putting them against a difficult situation they need to clear.
- It can be another fight, it can be a trap of some sort, or a puzzle, it doesn't matter.
- If you are preparing this dungeon with a gimmick in mind, this is the best place to act on it (for example, if you're inspired to make a Crypt dungeon, put some skeleton here with a Necromancer raising them. If you want a social betrayal scene, put a curse that forces your players one against the others, and so on).

### The Climax
- Simply put: the boss fight.
- This room's purpose is to be the grand finale of your dungeon, the last obstacle before the reward.
- Most commonly here will be a final boss that your party wants to defeat to reach the treasure, but you can add some twists to it if you want to make it more special: maybe the boss is open to a deal with the players, or a third party intervenes in the fight, either as allies or enemies.
- It doesn't need to be a straight up boss fight but it needs to be something big and memorable that the players will enjoy defeating.

### The Resolution
- This is the end of the dungeon, the players have managed to clear it and it's now time to conclude the story and reap the rewards.
- If you want a final twist you can decide to add some minor complications like traps on the chests, or a mimic.
- The players are now exhausted from the previous encounters so it's not reccommended to put any major obstacle here, as it will ruin the experience if a random second final boss appears and kills them after they managed to beat the real one.
- Make the players retrieve the loot, add a complication if you want a final little twist, finish the story and make the party leave the dungeon.

#### Farmer is Dead
If the farmer is permanently killed, the party gains 50 XP and can loot, if they want, the hut for resources. 
They find 1d4 + 2 [[Rations]] to share, and each player that loots finds 1d6 GP (each player rolls separately).
The hut stays abandoned and can be used as a safe resting place (TODO: decide what happens to the hut after some time)
If the Necromancer stays alive he will continue its operation, claiming another victim after a IRL week (TODO: create the next dungeon)
