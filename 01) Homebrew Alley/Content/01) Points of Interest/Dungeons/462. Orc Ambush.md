## The Dungeon Rooms

### The Entrance
> The forest path narrows as the light dims beneath the dense pines. Wind moans through hollow stones scattered along the ridge, sounding eerily like distant horns. You spot half-buried bones in the mud, humanoid, gnawed clean. Then, faint chanting echoes from somewhere unseen, rhythmic and low.
>
> The chanting swells suddenly, and a shimmer of pale green light spills from the trees. A figure steps into view: a towering orc shaman with bone piercings and a staff crowned with a skull that leaks green vapors. The smell of rot fills the air as the shaman raises a clawed hand and whispers in a guttural tone.
> The words twist in your minds, thick and heavy…  
> **“Dream, little prey. Dream of the pits.”**
>
> Each of you feels your eyelids grow unbearably heavy.

An Orc Shaman nearby is going to cast [[Sleep]], trying to put asleep as many adventurers that the spell is able to.
If the entire party falls asleep, move to [[#The Puzzle]].
If any member is still awake, a group of Orcs appears from the nearby bushes to attack them, using [[Blowgun|blowguns]] equipped with Tranquilizing and Paralyzing [[Dart|darts]] that will inflict either the [[Paralyzed]] or [[Unconscious]] condition when hit by the dart, if the character doesn't pass a Constitution Saving Throw of DC 15.
If the darts don't seem to work, the group of Orcs will use force to try and knock the party unconscious by putting their HP to 0.

The [[Tough|Orc]] party is composed of a Shaman (Sorcerer lv.1 with Sleep as one of the spells prepared) and atleast two other orcs (to be scaled based on party level).
If the Shaman is killed at any point by the players, the other Orcs flee towards the camp.

### The Puzzle
> You awaken to the echo of dripping water and guttural laughter. The smell of iron and damp earth fills the air. A dim reddish glow pulses from runes carved into the stone walls — faintly thrumming with power.
> You’re in a crude stone pen sealed by iron bars, one of many circling a pit below. Other captives mutter or weep in nearby cells: you see the missing party from Owlguard, goblins, even a wounded ogre. Across the pit, orc guards lounge near a fire, sharpening axes.
> 
> A voice hisses from the shadows of your cell. “New blood, eh? Best start praying. You fight tonight.”
> You turn to the direction of the voice and you see two other creatures imprisoned with you, a Goblin with a scarred-out eye and an half-orc sitting side-by-side.
> You see Gritmaw lounging on a pile of straw, chewing on something suspiciously finger-shaped, while Tovren sits cross-legged, sharpening a jagged piece of bone into a makeshift blade. 
> They look far too calm for prisoners.

The creature that spoke from inside the cell is [[Gritmaw the Goblin]], accompanied by his party companion [[Tovren, the Old Gladiator]]. They both are there willfully, enjoying fighting for the Orc crowd and reaping the rewards. Every couple of months they wander near the Orc camp trying to get caught.
They can help the party by either offering advice about the upcoming matches ([[#Showtime]]) or, if bribed or convinced, they know about an escape route dug out by a previous prisoner that's still unknown by the Orcs

#### Showtime
> **Tovren:** “You want to live through the first match, you don’t fight the monsters: you fight the crowd. Brutality and Showmanship are the two keywords you'll want to remember.”  
> **Gritmaw:** “Big orcs love noise. Make ‘em cheer, they stop caring who wins.”
- The arena runs on _spectacle_: the orcs reward flair and brutality. Fighting with style earns boons (healing, extra weapons tossed into the pit).
- The shaman’s **totem** channels the arena’s magic: the runes that prevent magic in the cells are weaker inside the ring, so casters can act again.
- The first fight is often **a test**, not an execution. If the crowd likes you, you might be spared, healed, or even offered “champion’s work.”
- If the players win _too easily_ or anger the crowd, the next fight will be rigged against them.

If the players follow this route and then enter the Arena, they have advantage on Charisma checks made during the fights, since they know what is expected of them by the crowd.
#### Escape route
When the players mention escape, Tovren narrows his eyes.

> “You think you’re the first to dream of crawling out of here? The Redfangs Arena has seen countless fighters through the years, many tried to escape, none managed to reach the forest alive.”

Gritmaw cackles.

> “Still… maybe you’re crazy enough to try. Crazy’s entertaining. And entertaining pays.” _He turns towards Tovren_ “you remember that weird Goblin? He was the only one mad enough to actually try and do it”.
> “Huh yeah.. I forgot about him... I wonder if he actually managed to escape or if the Orcs caught him.. but I haven't seen him in the arena since..”.

The players can try to convince them to offer information about the escape plan, using either Persuasion or Intimidation, or otherwise they can bribe them with something worth atleast 20gp.
If they succeed:

> **Gritmaw** leans back against the damp wall, eyes narrowing in amusement.  
> “Ha! You lot’ve got more guts than sense. Most just beg for mercy or try gnawin’ through the bars. But you… you’ve got that fire. I like it.”
> 
> He exchanges a glance with **Tovren**, who shrugs and mutters,  
> “Fine. They’ve earned it. If they die, they die: if not, it’ll make a good story.”
> 
> Gritmaw grins, revealing a tusk chipped from old battles.  
> “Behind that stack of crates in the corner, there’s a loose stone. Push it in, not out. You’ll find the tunnel the mad goblin dug a few months back before the orcs caught on. It leads under the stables and out to the river trench. Smells like troll piss, but it’ll get you clear.”
> 
> He spits into his palm and offers it for a shake.  
> “Don’t say we never did you a favor. And if you make it out… spread the word. Tell ’em Gritmaw and Tovren still own the pit.”

### The Setback
Above you, dozens of orcs crowd the edges, chanting half-heartedly. Some are drunk, others betting scraps of metal or teeth. The excitement feels… forced.

On a crude wooden platform, a large throne made of tusks and shields overlooks the arena. Upon it sits **King Grugnar Bonefire**, an enormous orc draped in furs, looking as though he’d rather be anywhere else. One elbow props his chin as he stares at the pit with weary eyes.

At his side stands **Ghorl the Announcer**, loud and theatrical, desperately trying to hype up a crowd that doesn’t really care anymore.

“Lords and beasts of Bonefire Hold!” Ghorl roars, his voice echoing through the pit. “Tonight, our glorious king brings you _fresh challengers_! The wild ones caught trespassing near the Bonefire cliffs!”

He gestures toward you, his grin sharp and showy. “Let’s see if they bleed prettier than the last lot!”

A few scattered cheers. Someone yawns.

King Grugnar sighs and waves a hand lazily. “Get on with it, Ghorl. The last fight took too long. Maybe if they die fast, I can get back to planning that Tarrasque hunt.”

The crowd laughs uncertainly — not sure if he’s joking. Ghorl laughs too, but nervously.  
“Of course, my king! Perhaps _these_ ones will surprise you!”

A heavy gate across the arena creaks open. A massive shape lumbers out — your chosen opponent. Ghorl slams his drum once, and a faint shimmer of red energy flickers to life around the pit, sealing it.

King Grugnar leans forward slightly, expression flat. “If they last more than two minutes, I’ll consider that progress.”
    

You’re trapped in the **Arena of Bonefire Hold.**

### The Climax
- Simply put: the boss fight.
- This room's purpose is to be the grand finale of your dungeon, the last obstacle before the reward.
- Most commonly here will be a final boss that your party wants to defeat to reach the treasure, but you can add some twists to it if you want to make it more special: maybe the boss is open to a deal with the players, or a third party intervenes in the fight, either as allies or enemies.
- The final challenge should test everything they’ve learned or endured in the previous rooms: the skills, clues, or choices that brought them here.
- It doesn't need to be a straight up boss fight but it needs to be something big and memorable that the players will enjoy defeating.
- Example:
> > The twisting corridors converge into a vast cavern bathed in a pale, inner light. At its center stands a massive crystal heart suspended in midair, encased in veins of living rock that pulse with energy. The air hums with power; ancient, rhythmic, and heavy.
> > The fragments of the fallen golem’s runes flicker along the cavern floor, drawn toward the crystal like iron filings to a magnet. The heart stirs, the stone veins tightening as a towering form begins to emerge: not a single guardian, but the essence that once animated them all.
> > The chamber trembles. The crystal pulses like a heartbeat. The final trial has awakened.

### The Resolution
- This is the end of the dungeon, the players have managed to clear it and **it's now time to conclude the story and reap the rewards**.
- If you want a final twist you can decide to add some minor complications like traps on the chests, or a mimic.
- **The players are now exhausted** (_in-game_ and _in real life_ as well) from the previous encounters, **so avoid major obstacles here**: the resolution should feel like *closure*, not punishment. If the party dies because of a secret second final boss that appears here, ==they will feel cheated out==.
- Make the players retrieve the loot, add a complication if you want a final little twist, finish the story and make the party leave the dungeon.
- If you want to continue the story behind this dungeon in another one, you may want to add some hints and hooks for the players here, so that they know there's still something to do about this.
- Example:
> > When the last echo of battle fades, the crystal heart dims, its light softening into a steady glow. 
> > The rock veins loosen and retract, reshaping into gentle curves of natural stone, but not before uncovering a little room with an altar in the middle of it, showing some engravings to the side of it, and a _**crystal shaped dagger**_ that seems to reflect light planted on top of it.
> > A soft wind moves through the chamber, the first sign of air in what felt like a tomb. The cave seems to breathe again. 
> > Where the crystal once hung, a small opening now leads upward, sunlight spilling through cracks in the ceiling.
> > The same voice that once warned you now whispers faintly from the walls:
> > “**_The way is open. The sanctum remembers._**”
> > The oppressive weight of the place lifts, leaving behind quiet, ancient peace, and the sense that something deep beneath the mountain _still watches_.
