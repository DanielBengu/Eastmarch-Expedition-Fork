# The Broken Angel
> > A marble statue of an angel rests near the connecting rivers.
> > Their eyes are closed, with its head tipped down. Their wings seems severed.
> > In front of their podium, a single stone feather rests on the muddy ground
> > Just above it, there are words written at the bottom of the podium.

## Rewards
Solving the riddle grants the player that solved it the [[Boon|boon]] of [[Feathered Fall]].

## Hints
- The words are in **Celestial** and say: "Fall with me once more."
- The [[Stone Feather]] is the same material as the statue, tho it doesn't look like it could be placed anywhere.

## Solving the Riddle
By free-falling at least 20ft. while carrying the [[Stone Feather]] the player completes the riddle:
> > While falling - for a second - you see yourself fall from an endless cloudy sky. White feathers being ripped upwards from your body.
> > The vision is as gone as quickly as it came, and you find yourself standing on the ground below.
> > Your friends look at your face perplexed, as a tattoo of a wing seems to have appeared under your left eye - marking you, for having pleased a statue.

When a player completes it, they lose the [[Stone Feather]] from their inventory, the [[The Broken Angel]] statue seems to have vanished into mist, and the player gains the [[Boon|boon]] of [[Feathered Fall]].

Once the player with theÂ [[Boon|boon]] dies, the crumbled statue seems to reconstruct from mist.
