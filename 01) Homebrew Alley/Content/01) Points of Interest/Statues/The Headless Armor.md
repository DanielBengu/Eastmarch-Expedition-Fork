# The Headless Armor
> > A granite statue of an armor hides between the trees. It stands tall on his podium, no helmet adorning it.
> > Two words are carved on the podium "Break me."

## Rewards
Solving the riddle grants the player that solved it the [[Boon|boon]] of [[True Armor]].

## Hints
- The words are in **Common** and say: "Break me."
- The statue is hollow
- The statue has no signs of wear or tear. It is in perfect conditions without even a scratch on the polished granite.

## Solving the Riddle
The statue has 1 Hit Point and an AC of 30. Is immune to all magic damage, as well as any non-piercing or non-bludgeoning damage. Any magical item cannot damage this statue.

When a player breaks the statue, they are granted the [[Boon|boon]] of [[True Armor]].
> > As you hit the statue you feel your body vibrate as a small crack appears on the armor.
> > The crack starts to slowly expand. Slowly picking up in speed as it covers the full armor. Then, the armor explodes in shards of stone flying outwards and turning into mist as they do so.

The player who completed the challenge has been marked at the back of their neck by the tattoo of a shield, marking them for having pleased a statue.

Once the player with theÂ [[Boon|boon]] dies, the crumbled statue seems to reconstruct from mist.
