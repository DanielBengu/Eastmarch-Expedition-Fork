# The Laughing Saint
> > A red porphyry statue of a human priest is slightly bent backwards in a laughing expression to the sky.

## Rewards
Solving the riddle grants the player that solved it the [[Boon|boon]] of [[The Red Saint]].

## Hints
- The surroundings clearly mark this statue as *deadly*.
- ***[[Investigation]] DC 15.*** Reveals the writings on the podium in **Celestial** which say: "Try your luck."

## Solving the Riddle
When a player touches the statue, they roll 1d100 with the following effects:

| Roll | Effect |
| - | - |
| 1 - 10 | They suffer 9d10 Necrotic damage |
| 11 - 20 | They suffer 8d10 Necrotic damage |
| 21 - 30 | They suffer 7d10 Necrotic damage |
| 31 - 40 | They suffer 6d10 Necrotic damage |
| 41 - 50 | They suffer 5d10 Necrotic damage |
| 51 - 60 | They suffer 4d10 Necrotic damage |
| 61 - 70 | They suffer 3d10 Necrotic damage |
| 71 - 80 | They suffer 2d10 Necrotic damage |
| 81 - 90 | They suffer 1d10 Necrotic damage |
| 91 - 99 | The body part that touched the statue becomes black, and the player gains the [[Chill Touch]] cantrip.<br>If you were previously unable to cast spells, use Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. |
| 00 | They player gains the [[Boon]] of [[The Red Saint]] - go to [[#Completed]] |

If a player reaches 0 HP due to the Necrotic damage from the statue, they have to succeed a *DC 20 Constitution Saving Throw.* If they fail, the player is [[Dead|dead]] and read the following:
> > You freeze in place, hand still extended touching the statue - vision going dark - as you take a final breath.
> > The skin starts to evaporate into red mist as the bones in your body get revealed.
> > In an instant, you are nothing more than a pile of bones.

If the player succeeded, move to a normal [[Death Saving Throw|death save]].

### Completed
> > The statue and the bones around it explode in red mist.
> > You let out a small gasp as the mist streams into your lungs filling you with a strange power.
> > The extremities of your fingertips become red as if tattooed. Your nails grow half an inch longer and sharper. Your eyes go black, devoid of colors.
> > You have pleased the statue.

The player gains the [[Boon|boon]] of [[The Red Saint]]. 

Once the player with theÂ [[Boon|boon]] dies, the crumbled statue seems to reconstruct from red mist.
