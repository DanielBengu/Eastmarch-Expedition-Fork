# The Broken Angel
> > A black basalt statue squats at the center of a scorched clearing.  
> > Its form is humanoid but exaggerated: limbs too long, shoulders too broad, and three horns twist in different directions: one forward, one back, and one snapped clean.  
> > The statue’s face bears a crooked grin and hollow eyes that seem to follow you.  
> > A broad stone bowl rests in its hands, its interior crusted dark red as though once brimming with dried blood.  

## Rewards
Solving the riddle grants the player that solved it the [[Boon|boon]] of [[Horned Dominion]].

## Hints
- The statue radiates faint **necrotic** and **enchantment** magic on _Detect Magic_.
- Beneath the bowl there's an Infernal writing that reads “The strong drink from the weak.”
- The bowl remains cold as iron no matter the weather.
- Near the clearing lies two other fallen statues: **devils of the same form as the one still standing**, toppled face-down in the dirt.
    
    - One of them has planted in its back a **black dagger**, the blade etched with curling Infernal runes that whisper faintly when touched.
    - The weapon is cursed: while held, the wielder occasionally hears a voice urging, _“Feed me, and I will feed you.”_ (tell only the player cursed, without letting other players hear)
    - The other one has a stab wound in the same place as well, with a crossed out black X scar on it.
        
- When the dagger is drawn free, the standing statue’s grin widens imperceptibly, and a thin trickle of red seeps from its eyes, running down into the waiting bowl.

## Solving the Riddle
The dagger, known as the **Thirst of Horns**, must be used to **draw the blood of a living ally**, by stabbing it (this will cause the stabbed player to drop down to 0 HP and knock unconscious (not dead), feeling its vital force being forcefully extracted into the knife).
When their blood is poured into the bowl, the crimson instantly vanishes, and the statue reacts:

> > The bowl blackens as if scorched from within.  
> > The devil’s hollow eyes ignite with dull red flame, and its broken horn grows an inch, as though nourished.  
> > Black smoke rises from the bowl and coils around the one who spilled the blood.  
> > A voice, soft and pleased, whispers in your mind:  
> > “Dominion is the right to take.”  
> > A spiral mark of three curving lines burns itself into your arm, fading to a faint ember.

The dagger evaporates into black mist, disappearing into the air.
A laugh is heard in the distance, while the two statues evaporates as well.
The member that got stabbed receives a permanent X black scar in the place where he got stabbed.
