# The Broken Angel
> > A black basalt statue squats at the center of a scorched clearing.  
> > Its form is humanoid but exaggerated: limbs too long, shoulders too broad, and three horns twist in different directions: one forward, one back, and one snapped clean.  
> > The statue’s face bears a crooked grin and hollow eyes that seem to follow you.  
> > A broad stone bowl rests in its hands, its interior crusted dark red as though once brimming with dried blood.  

## Rewards
Solving the riddle grants the player that solved it the [[Boon|boon]] of [[Horned Dominion]].

## Hints
- The statue radiates faint **necrotic** and **enchantment** magic on _Detect Magic_, and so does the dagger described below.
- Beneath the bowl there's an Infernal writing that reads “The strong drink from the weak.”
- The bowl remains cold as iron no matter the weather.
- Near the clearing lies two other fallen statues: **devils of the same form as the one still standing**, toppled face-down in the dirt.
> > One of them has planted in its back a **black dagger**, the blade etched with curling Infernal runes that whisper faintly when touched.
> > When a player grips the dagger’s handle, **a surge of searing heat races up their arm**, and a whisper curls through their mind:  
> > _“Feed me, and I will teach you to feed yourself”_. At that very moment, the player hears the devil statue start to laugh maniacally. When you turn around to look, the statue remains inanimate, but you keep hearing its laugh echo in your mind. You kno
- The other one has a stab wound in the same place as well, with a crossed out black X scar on it.
        
- When the dagger is drawn free, the standing statue’s grin widens imperceptibly, and a crossed out black X scar appears where the dagger was.

### Dagger is grabbed
> > When your hand grips the dagger's handle, you feel a surge of searing heat race up your arm, an immense magical power flow through you for a brief moment, and then a whisper curl through your mind: 
> > _"Feed me, and I will teach you to feed yourself"_.
> > You look back at the two face down statues and you understand; those devils were not enemies of the main devil, they were _allies_, stabbed by their own companion.
> > A maniacal laughter echoes in your mind, coming from the direction of the devil statue that's still standing. When you turn to look, the devil remains inanimate, but you notice its grin has widened a little bit. You know now what to do to please the devil: one of your weakling companions must be sacrificed. 

## Solving the Riddle
The dagger, known as the **Thirst of Horns**, must be used to **draw the blood of a living ally**, by stabbing it (this will cause the stabbed player to drop down to 0 HP and knock unconscious (not dead), feeling its vital force being forcefully extracted into the knife).
The devil wont force the cursed user to stab a companion, but the player will notice that it's disappointed every time uncertainty passes through your mind, considering you more and more one of the weaklings that lies face down instead of one of them, the stronger ones that still stand. In addition the player can feel the hunger that the Devil has, and understands that it will take a feast, one way or another. Someone must, **WILL**, feed him today.

If the cursed player refuses to stab the ally and tries to release the dagger, it will float in the air magically, everyone will hear the devil laughter for a bit and then they'll hear: "weak.... **WEAK**!!!". 
After that, the dagger will stab the merciful player, putting his HP to 0 and knocking him out unconscious. The dagger then vanishes, leaving a crossed out X black scar on the player, in addition to a permanent -1d4 HP. The dagger will reapper after 24hours, restarting the statue encounter until someone satisfies the devil.

When a companion is stabbed, their blood is magically poured into the bowl, the crimson instantly vanishes, and the statue reacts:

> > The bowl blackens as if scorched from within.  
> > The devil’s hollow eyes ignite with dull red flame, and its broken horn grows an inch, as though nourished.  
> > Black smoke rises from the bowl and coils around the one who spilled the blood.  
> > A voice, soft and pleased, whispers in your mind:  
> > “Dominion is the right to take.”  
> > A spiral mark of three curving lines burns itself under your right eye, fading to a faint ember.

The dagger evaporates into black mist, disappearing into the air.
A laugh is heard in the distance, while the two statues evaporates as well.
The member that got stabbed receives a permanent X black scar in the place where he got stabbed, in addition to a permanent -1d4 HP.
