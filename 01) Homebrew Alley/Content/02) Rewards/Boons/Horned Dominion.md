You gain the following benefits.

***Boon of the Three Horned Devil.*** Your soul bears the mark of infernal dominion.

- When you reduce a creature to **0 hit points**, regain **2 hit points**.
    
- Once per long rest, you may utter the Infernal command _“Karnoth”_:  
    Choose an ally within 30 feet that you see and choose a number from 1 to your current level. Roll a number of d6s equal to the number chosen. Your ally loses HP equal to the amount rolled (they can't go below 0), and you regain life equal to the amount they lost.
    
- The brand under your eye glows faintly whenever you lose this power.
