You gain the following benefits.

***Boon of the Three Horned Devil.*** Your soul bears the mark of infernal dominion.

- When you reduce a creature to **0 hit points**, regain **2 hit points**.
    
- Once per long rest, you may utter the Infernal command _“Karnoth”_:  
    Choose an ally within 30 feet. They lose your choice of a number of 1d6 up to or equal to your level, and you regain the same amount.
    
- The brand on your arm glows faintly whenever you steal life to preserve your own.
