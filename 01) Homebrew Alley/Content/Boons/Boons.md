# Boons of the Eastmarch Expedition
To differentiate rewards from *simple loot* in this West March Campaign, we introduce [[Boon|boons]].
[[Boon|Boons]] in the Eastmarch Expedition are character unique (meaning no more than one PC or NPC can have it at the time) rewards that can be achieved through exceptional adventuring.
