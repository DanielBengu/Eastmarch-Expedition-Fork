# Fay Courts
The Fay courts fall under these main courts:
- The [[Court of Goblins]]
- The [[Seelie Court]]
- The [[Unseelie Court]]

# Playing with Fey
The Fay in DnD are loosely Fay. A fay should be a creature that is morally ambiguous or alien to the normal player's morality. This does **not** mean that they do not have morals, but simply that their morals do not align with what we see as "morals" on Earth. The various courts fay describe specifically the morals associated with the creatures inhabiting those courts.

## Roleplaying Fey
When roleplaying a fey, attempt to focus on the aspects that make a Fey feel like a Fey. Most of the time they will rather start a conversation more than a fight. Each court will do it differently, but overall the Fey should be tricksters beings that cannot be comprehended by mortals.

## Morality
All Fey Courts follow their own morality. This means that they **do** have morality, they **do** see good and evil. However, apart from the framework on having good and evil, they do not follow the same rules as mortals. For example, it is generally accepted in mortal society that killing is evil. A Fay court may not care, or even see the death of other species as a *good* thing.
To properly represent the Fey, read the morality section of each court.

## Terrifying Creatures
Their ambiguous morality and trickster nature, make the Fey absolutely terrifying. Mortals struggle to understand the Fey morality, and therefore are scared of deals they make with them. The lure of power through their boons sometimes overshadow the curse, yet mortals are still weary. If they do make a contract with such a being, it will always be one in the fey best interest - whatever those may be.
