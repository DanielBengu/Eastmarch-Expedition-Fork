## Lore
“Moucherons serve as mercenaries in the Plane of Faerie. Just like their counterparts in the world material, they are uncompromising about payment, but like other fey, a moucheron has no use for gold. They get paid in blood instead.

“Moucherons are sanguivores, and quite peckish ones at that. Famed moucherons who have built their reputations through countless battles will only accept specific blood types as payment, some developing a taste for the fiendish, elemental, or celestial notes of extraplanar blood. Others just starting their mercenary careers may be content with the blood of beasts, but all moucherons are uncompromising with payment. A moucheron drinks at nightfall, and needs at least two or three liters of blood per day—half as much as is contained in the average human body..

“Moucherons serve whoever pays them faithfully, but see breaches in their contracts as the highest of offenses. They'll not hesitate to turn against their employer for sustenance, taking payment from their own body, no matter the circumstances that led to the delay in payment..

“When sated, moucherons are particularly gregarious fairies. They are a staple of the few settlements in the Plane of Faerie due to their social nature and their need and line of work. Moucherons are often seen at taverns, plazas, and fairy courts literally buzzing with excitement. They are ready to spar and hone their skills in the Way of the Five Blades, the traditional moucheron fighting technique, in which their stinger is used as their fifth sword. Their mood shifts drastically when they go too long without food, though; they become irritable, mean, and antisocial. Moucherons themselves detest this shift in their personalities, which often leads them to strike up friendships with much larger beings that will not miss the daily dose of blood that a moucheron needs to survive. The few giants that inhabit the Plane of Faerie are seldom seen without a cloud of moucherons circling them—not as pests, but as friends.”
