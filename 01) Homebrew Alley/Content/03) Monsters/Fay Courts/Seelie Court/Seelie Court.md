# Seelie Court
The Seelie Court is a Fey court with a strong sense of morality. The problem for mortals, is that their morality is alien to ours.
Specifically, this court favours **contracts**.

## Morality
The Seelie Court's moral code is as strict as any mortal's moral code, it just focuses on contracts and deals.
For a fay in the Seelie Court, holding to a deal (uncaring what the detriment to their own being might be) is what is morally just. Any fey from this court will see that a contract is upheld uncaring of the circumstances. To the fey of this court, **good** is to honour a deal. Their equivalent of **evil** is to go back on your word. Even if you have the best intentions and reasons to do so, weather the deal is fair, kind, or leads to suffering - it doesn't matter as it is left to the individual faerie. What is moral has to do with if the deal is honoured or not.
With that being said, some might still twist the wording of the contract to better suit their nefarious needs, while other might be just content with a loose contract to follow. Specifically, if a fay feels that they are entering a mutually beneficial contract, they will have no reason to twist the contract's words.

## Structure
Unlike DnD feudal fay structures, the Seelie Court is simply a collection of fey creatures that are bound together by their morals. Similarly how people tend to feel *at home* when placed with people that share their view of the world, fey in this court choose to be together due to their morality.
This morality is also what makes their whole economy a *deals of power* economy. They care little for gold or coin (or might not even understand the concept of money) as they aim to achieve their personal goals through deals and contracts. They might grant part of their magic to mortals in exchange for a steady supply of goods, or trade deals within their own to better suit their survival needs.
