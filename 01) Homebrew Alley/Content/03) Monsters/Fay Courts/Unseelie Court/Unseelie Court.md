# Unseelie Court
The Unseelie Court is a Fey court with a strong sense of morality. The problem for mortals, is that their morality is alien to ours.
Specifically, this court favours **codes**.

## Morality
The morality of an Unseelie Court's fay is all about how well they can uphold their codes. This makes these fey unreasonable to mortals. The faerie's code takes precedent to anything else that might be said or done which might not align with their code. For example. these codes could be a code of conduct, dictating exactly what they are and are not allowed to do.
To the fey of this court, **good** is to follow their codes. Their equivalent of **evil** is to go against the code they are under. For example, an Unseelie Fay whose code is to kill anyone that harms a specific tree, taking pity on someone who broke a branch of that tree to light a fire just so they can survive the freezing night, would be - according to their twisted morality - pure evil.

## Structure
Unseelie Court fey do not have a direct structure. Most of the fey in this court are lonely creatures whose paths are shaped by their strict codes. They have little interest in interacting with other creatures unless specified by their codes.
Similarly to the [[Seelie Court]], fay choose to become part of this court.
