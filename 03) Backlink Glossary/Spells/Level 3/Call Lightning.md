Call Lightning
Level 3 Conjuration (Druid)

Casting Time: Action

Range: 120 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a Cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Until the spell ends, you can take a Magic action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you’re outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.

Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot. The damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 3.
