Finger of Death
Level 7 Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

Casting Time: Action

Range: 60 feet

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 30 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a Zombie (see “Creature Stat Blocks”) that follows your verbal orders.
