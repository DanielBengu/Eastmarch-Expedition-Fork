Sanctuary
Level 1 Abjuration (Cleric)

Casting Time: Bonus Action

Range: 30 feet

Components: V, S, M (a shard of glass from a mirror)

Duration: 1 minute

You ward a creature within range. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack roll or a damaging spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or either choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesnâ€™t protect the warded creature from areas of effect.

The spell ends if the warded creature makes an attack roll, casts a spell, or deals damage.
