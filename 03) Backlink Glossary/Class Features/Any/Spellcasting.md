#### Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through means determined by your class. See [[07) Spells]] for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with your class's spells, which appear in that class's spell list at the end of the class's description. Spell lists also appear in the folder note for the [[Spells]] Backlink Glossary folder.

***Cantrips (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard Only).*** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard or Druid spell lists, three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric or Wizard spell lists, or four cantrips of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list depending on what class you obtained this feature from. Regardless of which class you obtained this feature from, when you gain a level in that class, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from that class's spell list. 

When you reach levels 4 and 10 in a class that grants you this feature, you learn another cantrip of your choice from that class's spell list. This is shown on the Cantrips columns of each Class Features table.

***Spell Slots.*** The Class Features tables show how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

***Prepared Spells of Level 1+.*** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose a number of level 1 spells from your class's spell list equal to the number in the Prepared Spells column of the Class Features table at the level you obtained this feature.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain class levels, as shown in that column. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. If another class feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as class spells for you.

***Changing Your Prepared Spells.*** Whenever you gain a Bard or Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another spell from that class's list for which you have spell slots. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared Cleric, Druid, and Wizard spells, replacing any of the spells with other spells from that class's list for which you have spell slots if you're a Cleric or Druid or from your spellbook if you're a Wizard. You can also replace one spell on your Paladin or Ranger list with another spell from that class's list for which you have spell slots.

***Spellcasting Ability.*** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric, Druid, and Ranger spells, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard, Paladin, and Sorcerer spells.

***Spellcasting Focus.*** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells, a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric and Paladin spells, a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid and Ranger spells, or an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer or Wizard spells. You can also use your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

***Spellbook (Wizard Only).*** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting Identify. You determine the bookâ€™s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Missile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended. Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.
