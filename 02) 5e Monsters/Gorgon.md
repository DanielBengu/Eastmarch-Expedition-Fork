Actions

Gore. Melee Attack Roll: +8, reach 5 ft. Hit: 18 (2d12 + 5) Piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature and the gorgon moved 20+ feet straight toward it immediately before the hit, the target has the Prone condition.

Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5–6). Constitution Saving Throw: DC 15, each creature in a 30-foot Cone. First Failure: The target has the Restrained condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. Second Failure: The target has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition.

Bonus Actions

Trample. Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 16, one creature within 5 feet that has the Prone condition. Failure: 16 (2d10 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. Success: Half damage.
