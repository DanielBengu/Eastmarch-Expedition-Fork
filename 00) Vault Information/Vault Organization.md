### Vault Information
This is the one stop shop for general vault information with some useful links to TTRPG and Obsidian resources. The pages in this section are:

- [[00) Vault Information]] is the landing page. It's a folder note, so you wont see it on the file list. To get back to it, you'll need to click the name of the folder.
- [[Vault Organization]] will be sort of a table of contents that lets you know how exactly I have the vault organized. That's this file here.
- [[Tips and Tricks]] will be a collection of useful formatting information or other helpful things relating to using Obsidian. Plugin suggestions will be here as well.
- [[Useful Code]] will be a one stop shop for copy/pasteable code. Make sure to do that in Source Mode to ensure it transfers properly. Feel free to use it as a code testing playground as well.
- [[Theme Testing]] will be your one stop shop for when you're making Appearance and Style Settings changes. Has a lot of the main content that will be affected.
- [[Acknowledgements]] will be where I list anyone I would like to thank for motivation, tips, etc. during my creation of this vault. I'll also list any useful resources here as well.
### Players
This contains the information that would be found in the *Player's Handbook* and the Players section of the free Basic Rules on D&D Beyond. Each file contains the full content of the SRD that pairs with the various pages of the D&D Beyond Basic Rules. This is the place you go to if you want to scroll through one big page like what you'd find in a book, PDF, etc. Anything that needs its own page, such as a spell, has its own file in Backlink Glossary, which is detailed below. The pages in this section are:

- [[01) Playing the Game]]
- [[02) Creating a Character]]
- [[03) Character Classes]]
- [[04) Character Origins]]
- [[05) Feats]]
- [[06) Equipment]]
- [[07) Spells]]
- [[08) Spell Descriptions]]
- [[09) Rules Glossary]]
### Dungeon Masters
This contains the information that would be found in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* and the Dungeon Masters section of the free Basic Rules on D&D Beyond. Each file contains the full content of the SRD that pairs with the various pages of the D&D Beyond Basic Rules. This is the place you go to if you want to scroll through one big page like what you'd find in a book, PDF, etc. Anything that needs its own page, such as a magic item, has its own file in Backlink Glossary, which is detailed below. The pages in this section are:

- [[01) The Basics]]
- [[02) DM's Toolbox]]
- [[03) Magic Items]]
- [[04) Magic Items A - Z]]

Check out DnD Beyond for Downloadable Tracking Sheets that I unfortunately can't just include despite them being free to access due to them not being in the SRD.
### Monsters
Unlike the Players and Dungeon Masters sections, this one does contain a bunch of individual files. I'll use the main [[03) Monsters]] folder note to list all of the "Introduction: How to Use a Monster" content and all the stat blocks will have their own individual file. Useful tables like organizing by CR, Type, Terrain, etc. will be included in the [[00) Creature Tables]] file. I am listing the stat blocks purely in alphabetical order, so they'll be sorted the same way that the Rules > Monsters search function on D&D Beyond is sorted. If you'd like to group them the way the *Monster Manual* does, feel free to create subfolders and slide the files right in. Any backlinks should automatically update to recognize the new file location.
### Backlink Glossary
This is where the backlink magic happens. Anything and everything that needs to be a quick, intuitive backlink, goes here. For instance, while I have all the spells organized the way the SRD does in the Spell Descriptions file, I also have individual spell files to link to on stat blocks simply by putting the spell name in double brackets. 

I've tried to make sure that no two files have the same name to prevent conflicts, but if you add any files yourself with the same name as another file, it may append the folder path to the front to specify which of the two it's linking to. If you want to see what I mean, [[04) Backlink Glossary/Senses/Darkvision|Darkvision]] vs *[[04) Backlink Glossary/Spells/Level 2/Darkvision|Darkvision]]* is a perfect example.

All files generated within a folder will have the relevant Supercharged Links tag to make sure they pop up as the right color when backlinking to them. Some might populate even if you don't need it. If this happens just delete the template text to start with a blank canvas.

Personally, I'd put all new content in its own folder to not clog the official content folders, but if you don't want to split it up, here are the folder descriptions of what goes where if you'd like to keep the same organization.

***Actions.*** You shouldn't ever have to add anything here unless you are modifying the rules of the game to include new [[Action|actions]].

***Areas of Effect.*** You shouldn't ever have to add anything here unless you are modifying the rules of the game to include new [[Area of Effect|area of effect]] types.

***Backgrounds.*** This is the folder containing backgrounds. A pretty basic folder that will just include an A to Z file list of each background with no further organization needed.

***Class Features.*** This is the folder containing class features, divided into class subfolders and a folder for multi class features such as [[Extra Attack]]. Subfolders within each class subfolder provides further organization for separating subclass features. One folder per subclass. The purpose of this folder is to provide easy backlinking if you decide to make a compact character sheet with just the feature names or need to reference a particular feature in the text of another, such as how some Barbarian features mention additional effects "while raging." Useful to be able to backlink to the Rage feature directly in those cases. Also helps when making class feature tables. Any additional features like Metamagic options or Eldritch Invocations will have their own folder within the appropriate parent folder as well.

***Classes.*** This is the folder containing a folder note for the full description of each class filled with files for the full description of each subclass

***Conditions.*** You shouldn't ever have to add anything here unless you are modifying the rules of the game to include new [[Condition|conditions]].

***Contagions.*** This is the folder for any magical sicknesses called Magical Contagions details in [[02) DM's Toolbox]].

***Environmental Effects.*** This is the folder for the environmental effects detailed in [[02) DM's Toolbox]].

***Equipment.*** This is the folder for adventuring gear, armor, weapons, tools, and any other non-magical gear. Split into Subfolders based on the various Equipment tables.

***Feats.*** This is the folder for feats, split into subfolders based on the Origin, General, Fighting Style, and Epic Boon categories.

***Hazards.*** You shouldn't ever have to add anything here unless you are modifying the rules of the game to include new [[Hazard|hazards]].

***Lore.*** While this folder will be mostly useless at first due to the SRD not containing any of it, I have at least made it since certain stat blocks reference things like the [[Abyss]] and need to be properly backlinked. Feel free to use this folder as your one stop shop to place characters, locations, planes, and any other world lore.

***Magic Items.*** This is the folder for magic items and is split into subfolders based on rarity with a subfolder for items such as *[[Potions of Healing]]* that vary in rarity so that I have something to backlink to whenever text refers to the generic version of the item. There will also be the specific rarity variants in the rarity folders as well. *[[Spell Scroll|Spell Scrolls]]* have their own folder as well so that each spell can have its own file premade and ready to go and that would clog the other sections too much. Items like armor and weapons that can be applied to multiple different base weapons will have folders with a folder note for the main item and each possible variant inside if there are more than 2 variants.

***Properties.*** This is the folder where item properties go, though it is primarily weapon and weapon mastery properties. Masteries are split into their own subfolder for organization purposes. As with a few of the other folders, you really shouldn't have to touch this unless you've homebrewed up some new base or mastery weapon properties. If your world doesn't consider adamantine armor or silvered weapons to be magic items, but rather have those as intrinsic properties to armor made of those materials, you could absolutely also put Adamantine and Silvered as properties here to then backlink on their respective items.

***Rules.*** This is where the general rules that aren't categorized like actions and hazards go. I didn't put the entire Rules Glossary in here and instead focused on just the things you're likely to want to backlink to. If a homebrew rule you want to easily backlink to doesn't fit anywhere else, this is probably the place for it. You can also absolutely take something from the Rules Glossary and plop it into its own file here if you want to backlink to it.

***Senses.*** You shouldn't ever have to add anything here unless you are modifying the rules of the game to include new [[Special Senses|special senses]].

***Skills.*** You shouldn't ever have to add anything here unless you are modifying the rules of the game to include new [[Skill|skills]]

***Species.*** This is the folder containing species information. Unlike classes, I will not be creating a whole main folder for them, but rather, there will be a Species Features subfolder with the same intent in mind as the Class Features folder. I won't worry about organizing those features by species or anything, it'll just be one big A to Z list of the various features granted across the various species.

***Spells.*** This is the folder for spells and is split into subfolders based on spell level.

***Traps.*** This is the folder for any traps detailed in [[02) DM's Toolbox]].
### Homebrew Alley
This is the home of the Attachments and Templates folders. It's also where I'd personally store your homebrew content to keep it in its own nice box unless you prefer it mingled in with everything else. The main folder note will include instructions on how to use each template. Feel free to ignore the Auto Tag folder as it only exists to facilitate Templater automatically providing tagged notes in certain folders. [[Lore Tag]] is probably about the only template you'd ever need to worry about in here if you plan on duplicating it to create templates for locations, characters, etc. but want them to all just use that base lore tag the way D&D Beyond does.

Here is the list of useful templates. Make your way over to [[05) Homebrew Alley]] for full instructions on how I have them set up and how to use them.
- [[Armor]]
- [[Background]]
- [[Class]]
- [[Creature]]
- [[Eldritch Invocation]]
- [[Equipment]]
- [[Feat]]
- [[Magic Item]]
- [[Metamagic Option]]
- [[Poison]]
- [[Species]]
- [[Spell]]
- [[Tool]]
- [[Weapon]]

You may also notice a Corvid Compendium folder. This folder contains personal templates such as my Session Notes template. This is a folder you can feel free to delete if you want, though some of the templates may be useful to you. I just have them sectioned off since they're not relevant to the core vault.

If you want to use a different folder as your templates folder, set that new folder in Settings > Core plugins > Templates and then in Settings > Community plugins > Templater. Drag and drop the files into the new folder and then fix all the file pathing in the Templater settings to make sure it's all working okay. You can also swap which folder certain templates generate in / add more folders in the Templater settings as well. You can do the same for the Attachments folder, though that setting is under Settings > Options > Files and links. Attachments don't need to be in that folder to work or be linked. Setting the folder just means any new images you generate in the vault, such as pasting them in, will default to going in that folder.

Lastly, in the Attachments folder you can ignore the Tutorial Images folder. That's just where I'm storing all the screenshots to the insert into the Homebrew Alley folder note to have visual aids.
