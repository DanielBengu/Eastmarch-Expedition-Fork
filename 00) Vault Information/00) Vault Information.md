> If you did not get a pop up asking you for plugin permission when you opened this vault and all you see in the file explorer is "D&D 5e 2024 Rules" then you opened the wrong folder as vault. Windows 11's unzipper puts it in a folder based on the name of the .zip file, whereas WinRar makes the top level folder the "D&D 5e 2024 Rules" folder and doesn't have that issue.  Open that 2024 Rules folder as the vault and it should ask you for permissions along with having all the correct folders like 00) Vault Information, 01) Homebrew Alley, etc. in the file browser.
# Welcome to the Eastmarch Expedition
The original vault was created by [Nax, the Raven](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kJeOQH-ZQwo5o11Zv0RYJ-XXP9hBqijP) as a tool to assist DMs using the 2024 rules for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Every piece of official content in this vault can be found for free on D&D Beyond and is part of the SRD for the 2024 rules. Any published content not found in the SRD PDF will not be found in this vault by default.. 

Certain things will be named differently, such as the *[[Mysterious Deck]]* being the *Deck of Many Things* in the actual DMG. This along with name removals from spells like *[[Hideous Laughter]]* was done to make sure we're copying from the SRD only. If you'd like to swap them to their *Player's Handbook* / *Dungeon Master's Guide* variants, feel free to rename them.

While no artwork is in the SRD, I can absolutely let you know that you don't have to own a creature, item, etc. on D&D Beyond to access and download its art. Heck you don't even have to be logged in to gain access to that treasure trove of images. Put it in the attachments folder (organized into subfolders as you see fit) and you'll be able to insert it into any page by referencing it with double brackets and putting a ! in front so it displays automatically on the page.

When this vault refers to the *Player's Handbook*, *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and *Monster Manual*, it is referring to the new publications of them for the 2024 ruleset. I will tag the old ones with a (2014) when speaking about the original trio of core rulebooks for this edition.

Lastly, the vault has been updated by the [[Authors]] and the Homebrew content is subject to the license that can be found [[LICENSE|here]].
