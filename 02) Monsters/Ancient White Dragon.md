Freezing Burst. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 20, each creature in a 30-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet. Failure: 14 (4d6) Cold damage, and the target’s Speed is 0 until the end of the target’s next turn. Failure or Success: The dragon can’t take this action again until the start of its next turn.
