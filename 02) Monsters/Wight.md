Traits

Sunlight Sensitivity. While in sunlight, the wight has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls.

Actions

Multiattack. The wight makes two attacks, using Necrotic Sword or Necrotic Bow in any combination. It can replace one attack with a use of Life Drain.

Necrotic Sword. Melee Attack Roll: +4, reach 5 ft. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) Slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) Necrotic damage.

Necrotic Bow. Ranged Attack Roll: +4, range 150/600 ft. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) Piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) Necrotic damage.

Life Drain. Constitution Saving Throw: DC 13, one creature within 5 feet. Failure: 6 (1d8 + 2) Necrotic damage, and the target’s Hit Point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the damage taken.

A Humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a Zombie under the wight’s control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at a time.
