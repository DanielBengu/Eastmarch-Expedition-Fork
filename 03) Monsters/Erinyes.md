Magic Resistance. The erinyes has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Magic Rope. The erinyes has a magic rope. While bearing it, the erinyes can use the Entangling Rope action. The rope has AC 20, HP 90, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. The rope turns to dust if reduced to 0 Hit Points, if it is 5+ feet away from the erinyes for 1 hour or more, or if the erinyes dies.
